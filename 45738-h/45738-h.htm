</p>


<p>Dedications are usually
designed to flatter the Great, to acknowlege
their services, or court their favor
and influence. But very different motives
have led me to prefix the venerable
name of <span class="smcap">Franklin</span> to this publication.</p>

<p>Respect for his Excellency's talents
and exertions, as a great Philosopher and
a warm Patriot, I feel in common with
all the lovers of science and freedom; but
my peculiar admiration of his character,
arises from considering it as <i>great</i> in
<i>common things</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>His Excellency has not labored to
perplex himself and confound his countrymen
with ingenious theories in ethics,
and unintelligible speculations in theology
and metaphysics. He has not compiled
volumes to prove or disprove the probability
of universal salvation, or the eternal
duration of future punishments; content
with a plain doctrine, taught by philosophy
and common sense, and confirmed by
christianity, that virtue and happiness,
vice and punishment, are inseparably connected,
and that "if we do well here, we
shall fare well hereafter." In the most
elevated stations of life, his Excellency
has never been above a constant application
to some useful business; thus complying
with that precept of the fourth command,
"<i>six days shalt thou labor and do all
thy work</i>," which is as positive an injunction,
and as binding upon all men, as the
first article, "<i>remember the Sabbath day, to
keep it holy</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span></p>

<p>In his philosophical researches, he has
been guided by experiment, and sought
for <i>practical truths</i>. In the world, he has
been industrious to collect <i>facts</i>, (which
compose all our knowlege) and apply
them to the most useful purposes of government,
agriculture, commerce, manufactures,
rural, domestic and moral economy.
In communicating his ideas he
does not sacrifice truth to embellishment.
His stile is plain and elegantly neat; and
his remarks are not so general as to leave
his ideas indefinite and obscure. His pen
follows his thoughts, and consequently
leads the reader, without study, into the
same train of thinking. In short, he writes
for the child as well as the philosopher,
and always writes well, because he never
takes pains to write.</p>

<p>Violently attached to no political
party, he labors to reconcile contending
factions in government. Convinced, by
the experience of a long life, that all men
are liable to err, and acknowleging "that
he has often found himself mistaken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
had occasion to change his opinions," he
consents to measures which his judgement
tells him are <i>theoretically wrong</i>, when the
voices of a majority declare them to be
<i>practically right</i>.</p>

<p>He never attempts to usurp the divine
prerogative of controlling opinions; never
charges another with ignorance, knavery
and folly, nor endeavors to stab his reputation,
for not subscribing a particular
creed; much less does he ever assume a
dictatorial authority, and sentence to final
damnation, those who have the same
chance of being right as himself, and
whose conduct, whatever may be their
opinions, is regulated by the rules of moral
and social virtue.</p>

<p>For these reasons, as well as for the age,
the eminent rank and public merits of this
illustrious defender of American freedom,
I revere a character equally known and respected
in this and foreign countries.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Young gentlemen who have gone
through a course of academical studies, and received
the usual honors of a University, are apt to contract a
singular stiffness in their conversation. They read
Lowth's Introduction, or some other grammatical treatise,
believe what they read, without examining the
grounds of the writer's opinion, and attempt to shape
their language by his rules. Thus they enter the world
with such phrases as, <i>a mean</i>, <i>averse from</i>, <i>if he have</i>, <i>he
has gotten</i>, and others which they deem <i>correct</i>; they
pride themselves, for some time, in their superior learning
and peculiarities; till further information, or the
ridicule of the public, brings them to use the language
of other people.</p>

<p>Such has been my progress, and that of many of my
cotemporaries. After being some years in that excellent
school, the world, I recommenced my studies, endeavored,
not merely to learn, but to understand, the
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, of the English language, and in 1783 compiled
and published the First Part of my Grammatical Institute.
The favorable reception of this, prompted me
to extend my original plan, which led to a further investigation
of the principles of language. After all my
reading and observation for the course of ten years, I
have been able to unlearn a considerable part of what
I learnt in early life; and at thirty years of age, can,
with confidence, affirm, that our modern grammars
have done much more hurt than good. The authors
have labored to prove, what is obviously absurd, viz.
that our language is not made right; and in pursuance
of this idea, have tried to make it over again, and persuade
the English to speak by Latin rules, or by arbitrary
rules of their own. Hence they have rejected
many phrases of pure English, and substituted those
which are neither English nor sense. Writers and
Grammarians have attempted for centuries to introduce
a subjunctive mode into English, yet without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
effect; the language requires none, distinct from the
indicative; and therefore a subjunctive form stands in
books only as a singularity, and people in practice pay
no regard to it. The people are right, and a critical
investigation of the subject, warrants me in saying, that
common practice, even among the unlearned, is generally
defensible on the principles of analogy, and the
structure of the language, and that very few of the alterations
recommended by Lowth and his followers,
can be vindicated on any better principle than some
Latin rule, or his own private opinion.</p>

<p>Some compilers have also attempted to introduce a
<i>potential mode</i>, where they arrange those phrases that
have the <i>auxiliary</i> verbs, as they are called, <i>can</i>, <i>may</i>, &amp;c.
But all the helping verbs are principal verbs, and the
verb following them is generally in the infinitive. <i>I
can go</i>, <i>he may write</i>, <i>we shall see</i>, &amp;c. are only a customary
ellipsis of <i>I can to go</i>, <i>he may to write</i>, <i>we shall to
see</i>; and are no more a potential mode than <i>I dare go</i>,
<i>we saw him rise</i>.</p>

<p>In the indeclinable parts of speech, all authors were
mistaken, till Mr. Horne Tooke explained them: Our
conjunctions are mostly verbs in the imperative mode:
Our adverbs and prepositions are mostly verbs, nouns
and adjectives, either separate or combined; and the
proper definition of adverb and preposition, is, "a word,
or union of words, without the ordinary rules of government."
<i>Because</i> is a compound of the verb <i>be</i>, in
the imperative, and the noun <i>cause</i>; <i>otherwise</i> is merely
a corruption of <i>other ways</i>; <i>wherefore</i> is a corruption
of the Roman <i>qua-re</i>, with the addition of <i>for</i>; <i>wisely</i> is
nothing more than the two adjectives <i>wise like</i>. So that
in many cases, the want of a space between two words,
or of the usual rules of government, is the only circumstance
that distinguishes them from ordinary nouns and
verbs; that is, the only thing that makes them <i>adverbs</i>
or <i>prepositions</i>; such as, <i>because</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>beyond</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>behind</i>,
<i>forward</i>, <i>backward</i>. In short, had the English
never been acquainted with Greek and Latin, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
would never have thought of one half the distinctions
and rules which make up our English grammars.</p>

<p>The object of grammar, in a living language, is usually
misunderstood. Men often suppose they must
learn their native language by grammar; whereas they
learn the language first, and grammar afterwards. The
principal business of a compiler of a grammar is, to separate
<i>local</i> or <i>partial</i> practice from the <i>general custom</i> of
speaking; and reject what is <i>local</i>, whether it exists among
the great or the small, the learned or ignorant,
and recommend that which is universal, or general, or
which conforms to the analogies of structure in a language.
Whether the words <i>means</i>, <i>pains</i>, <i>news</i>, ought
to have been used originally in the singular form; or
<i>sheep</i>, <i>deer</i>, <i>hose</i>, in the plural; or in other words, whether
the language is well made, or might in some instances
be mended, are questions of little consequence now; it
is our business to find what the English language <i>is</i>, and
not, how it <i>might have been made</i>. The most difficult
task now to be performed by the advocates of <i>pure English</i>,
is to restrain the influence of men, learned in Greek
and Latin, but ignorant of their own tongue; who have
laboured to reject much good English, because they
have not understood the original construction of the
language. Should the following Dissertations produce
this effect, in the smallest degree, they may render essential
service to our native tongue.</p>

<p>These Dissertations derive their origin from accidental
circumstances, the history of which is briefly this.
The necessity of securing the copy right of the Grammatical
Institute in the different states, seconded by a
desire of being acquainted with my own country, induced
me to suspend my professional pursuits, and visit
the Southern States. While I was waiting for the
regular Sessions of the Legislatures, in those states
which had not passed laws for protecting literary property,
I amused myself in writing remarks on the English
Language, without knowing to what purpose they
would be applied. They were begun in Baltimore in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
the summer of 1785; and at the persuasion of a friend,
and the consent of the Rev. Dr. Allison, whose politeness
deserves my grateful acknowlegements, they
were read publicly to a small audience in the Presbyterian
Church. They were afterward read in about
twenty of the large towns between Williamsburg in
Virginia, and Portsmouth in New Hampshire. These
public readings were attended with various success;
the audiences were generally small, but always respectable;
and the readings were probably more useful to
myself than to my hearers. I every where availed myself
of the libraries and conversation of learned men, to
correct my ideas, and collect new materials for a
treatise, which is now presented to the public.</p>

<p>There are few men who do not at times find
themselves at a loss, respecting the true pronunciation
of certain words. Having no principles or rules, by
which they can solve questions of this kind, they imitate
some gentleman, whose abilities and character entitle
his opinions to respect, but whose pronunciation
may be altogether accidental or capricious.</p>

<p>With respect to many words, I have been in the
same uncertainty; and used formerly to change my
pronunciation, in conformity to the practice of the
last man of superior learning whom I heard speak.
My enquiries have been directed to investigate some
principles, which will remove all difficulties in pronunciation;
the result of which is a full satisfaction in my
own mind as to almost every particular word. Whether
the principles will prove equally satisfactory to others,
it is impossible now to determine. Most of the varieties
in pronunciation are mentioned in the second and third
Dissertations; those which are not, the reader will be
enabled to adjust on the principles there unfolded.</p>

<p>It will be observed, that many of the remarks in this
publication are not new. This will be no objection to
the main design; as some remarks which are found in
other philological treatises, are necessary to the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
plan of this. A great part however of my opinions are
new, and many of them directly opposed to the rules
laid down by former writers.</p>

<p>In the singularity of spelling certain words, I am authorized
by Sidney, Clarendon, Middleton, Blackstone,
Ash, or other eminent writers, whose authority, being
supported by good principles and convenience, is deemed
superior to that of Johnson, whose pedantry has corrupted
the purity of our language, and whose principles
would in time destroy all agreement between the spelling
and pronunciation of words. I once believed that
a reformation of our orthography would be unnecessary
and impracticable. This opinion was hasty; being
the result of a slight examination of the subject. I now
believe with Dr. Franklin that such a reformation is
practicable and highly <i>necessary</i>.</p>

<p>It has been my aim to support my opinions by numerous
and respectable authorities. In some cases, an
author is quoted, but not the chapter or page. This
was owing to neglect in first transcribing passages,
which was often done, without any design to use the
quotations as authorities in the present work; and the
passages could not afterwards be found without great
trouble, and sometimes the author could not be a second
time procured. In a very few instances, a quotation
has been taken at second hand on the credit of a
faithful writer; but never when I could obtain the
original work. Many other ancient authors would
have been consulted, had it been practicable; but the
most valuable of these are very scarce, and many of them
I have not heard of in America. It is to be lamented
that old authors are neglected, and modern libraries
composed of abridgements, compilations, short essays,
&amp;c. which are calculated only for communicating some
general information and making superficial scholars, to
the prejudice of profound learning and true science.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>
<p>The American student is often obliged, and too often
disposed, to drink at the streams, instead of mounting to
the sources of information.</p>

<p>For the remarks on English Verse in the fifth Dissertation,
I am much indebted to the celebrated author
of M'Fingal, a gentleman who has "drank deep of the
Pierian Spring," and who is equally distinguished for
wit, erudition, correct taste, and professional knowlege.</p>

<p>In explaining the principles of the language, I have
aimed at perspicuity, with a view to render the work
useful to all classes of readers. The Notes at the end
are designed to illustrate some points by authorities or
arguments that could not be properly arranged in the
text; and to throw some light on ancient history. To
the curious enquirer, these may be as entertaining as the
Dissertations themselves. In two or three instances, I
have found occasion to change my opinion, since the
publication of the Institute; but a future edition of that
work will be conformed to the criticisms in these Dissertations.</p>

<p>To those who ask where a writer was born and educated,
before they can ascertain the value of his writings,
I can only observe, it is expected this publication will
fare like all others. Men every where suppose that
their own state or country has some excellence that does
not belong to their neighbors; and it is well, if they
do not arrogate a superiority in <i>every</i> respect. They
think their own colleges the best; their professional men
the most learned, and their citizens the most liberal and
polite. I have been witness to numberless remarks and
insinuations of this kind in almost every state in the
union; and after personal observation, can affirm that
they generally proceed from gross ignorance, or unpardonable
prejudice. But it is very natural for men to
think and say all these things of <i>home</i>, when they have
little or no knowlege of any thing <i>abroad</i>.</p>

<p>Convinced that a writer is apt to overlook his own
mistakes, when they are very obvious to a reader, I have
submitted these Dissertations to the criticism of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
judges of the subject, with full liberty of altering, amending
and expunging any part of the work; by which
means several passages have been omitted and others
corrected. Still there may be faults in the book; and
as truth is the object of my enquiries, whenever the
friendly critic shall point out any errors, either in fact
or opinion, it will be my pride and pleasure to acknowlege
and correct them. Many years experience has
taught me that the public, when well informed, usually
form a very just opinion of a man and his writings, and
I am perfectly disposed to acquiesce in their decision.</p>

<p>P. S. Several Essays, on more important subjects,
intended for an Appendix to this work, are necessarily
reserved for a future volume.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/image017c.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A</span> regular study of language
has, in all civilized
countries, formed a part of
a liberal education. The
Greeks, Romans, Italians
and French successively improved
their native tongues, taught them
in Academies at home, and rendered them
entertaining and useful to the foreign student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The English tongue, tho later in its
progress towards perfection, has attained
to a considerable degree of purity, strength
and elegance, and been employed, by an
active and scientific nation, to record almost
all the events and discoveries of ancient
and modern times.</p>

<p>This language is the inheritance which
the Americans have received from their
British parents. To cultivate and adorn
it, is a task reserved for men who shall understand
the connection between language
and logic, and form an adequate idea of
the influence which a uniformity of speech
may have on national attachments.</p>

<p>It will be readily admitted that the
pleasures of reading and conversing, the
advantage of accuracy in business, the necessity
of clearness and precision in communicating
ideas, require us to be able to
speak and write our own tongue with ease
and correctness. But there are more important
reasons, why the language of this
country should be reduced to such fixed
principles, as may give its pronunciation
and construction all the certainty and uniformity
which any living tongue is capable
of receiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The United States were settled by emigrants
from different parts of Europe.
But their descendants mostly speak the
same tongue; and the intercourse among
the learned of the different States, which
the revolution has begun, and an American
Court will perpetuate, must gradually
destroy the differences of dialect which our
ancestors brought from their native countries.
This approximation of dialects will
be certain; but without the operation of
other causes than an intercourse at Court,
it will be slow and partial. The body of
the people, governed by habit, will still
retain their respective peculiarities of
speaking; and for want of schools and
proper books, fall into many inaccuracies,
which, incorporating with the language of
the state where they live, may imperceptibly
corrupt the national language. Nothing
but the establishment of schools and
some uniformity in the use of books, can
annihilate differences in speaking and preserve
the purity of the American tongue.
A sameness of pronunciation is of considerable
consequence in a political view; for
provincial accents are disagreeable to strangers
and sometimes have an unhappy effect
upon the social affections. All men
have local attachments, which lead them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
to believe their own practice to be the least
exceptionable. Pride and prejudice incline
men to treat the practice of their neighbors
with some degree of contempt. Thus
small differences in pronunciation at first
excite ridicule&mdash;a habit of laughing at the
singularities of strangers is followed by disrespect&mdash;and
without respect friendship is
a name, and social intercourse a mere ceremony.</p>

<p>These remarks hold equally true, with
respect to individuals, to small societies and
to large communities. Small causes, such
as a nick-name, or a vulgar tone in speaking,
have actually created a dissocial spirit
between the inhabitants of the different
states, which is often discoverable in private
business and public deliberations.
Our political harmony is therefore concerned
in a uniformity of language.</p>

<p>As an independent nation, our honor
requires us to have a system of our own,
in language as well as government. Great
Britain, whose children we are, and whose
language we speak, should no longer be
<i>our</i> standard; for the taste of her writers is
already corrupted, and her language on
the decline. But if it were not so, she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
at too great a distance to be our model,
and to instruct us in the principles of our
own tongue.</p>

<p>It must be considered further, that the
English is the common root or stock from
which our national language will be derived.
All others will gradually waste away&mdash;and
within a century and a half,
North America will be peopled with a
hundred millions of men, <i>all speaking the
same language</i>. Place this idea in comparison
with the present and possible future
bounds of the language in Europe&mdash;consider
the Eastern Continent as inhabited
by nations, whose knowlege and intercourse
are embarrassed by differences of
language; then anticipate the period when
the people of one quarter of the world,
will be able to associate and converse together
like children of the same family.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Compare this prospect, which is not visionary,
with the state of the English language
in Europe, almost confined to an Island
and to a few millions of people; then let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>reason and reputation decide, how far America
should be dependent on a transatlantic
nation, for her standard and improvements
in language.</p>

<p>Let me add, that whatever predilection
the Americans may have for their native
European tongues, and particularly the
British descendants for the English, yet
several circumstances render a future separation
of the American tongue from the
English, necessary and unavoidable. The
vicinity of the European nations, with the
uninterrupted communication in peace,
and the changes of dominion in war, are
gradually assimilating their respective languages.
The English with others is suffering
continual alterations. America,
placed at a distance from those nations,
will feel, in a much less degree, the influence
of the assimilating causes; at the
same time, numerous local causes, such as
a new country, new associations of people,
new combinations of ideas in arts and science,
and some intercourse with tribes
wholly unknown in Europe, will introduce
new words into the American tongue.
These causes will produce, in a course of
time, a language in North America, as different
from the future language of Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>land,
as the modern Dutch, Danish and
Swedish are from the German, or from
one another: Like remote branches of a
tree springing from the same stock; or rays
of light, shot from the same center, and
diverging from each other, in proportion
to their distance from the point of separation.</p>

<p>Whether the inhabitants of America
can be brought to a perfect uniformity in
the pronunciation of words, it is not easy to
predict; but it is certain that no attempt
of the kind has been made, and an experiment,
begun and pursued on the right
principles, is the only way to decide the
question. Schools in Great Britain have
gone far towards demolishing local dialects&mdash;commerce
has also had its influence&mdash;and
in America these causes, operating
more generally, must have a proportional
effect.</p>

<p>In many parts of America, people at
present attempt to copy the English phrases
and pronunciation&mdash;an attempt that is
favored by their habits, their prepossessions
and the intercourse between the two
countries. This attempt has, within the
period of a few years, produced a multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>tude
of changes in these particulars, especially
among the leading classes of people.
These changes make a difference between
the language of the higher and common
ranks; and indeed between the <i>same</i>
ranks in <i>different</i> states; as the rage for
copying the English, does not prevail equally
in every part of North America.</p>

<p>But besides the reasons already assigned
to prove this imitation absurd, there is a
difficulty attending it, which will defeat
the end proposed by its advocates; which
is, that the English themselves have no
standard of pronunciation, nor can they
ever have one on the plan they propose.
The Authors, who have attempted to give
us a standard, make the practice of the
court and stage in London the sole criterion
of propriety in speaking. An attempt
to establish a standard on this foundation
is both <i>unjust</i> and <i>idle</i>. It is unjust, because
it is abridging the nation of its rights:
The <i>general practice</i> of a nation is the rule
of propriety, and this practice should at
least be consulted in so important a matter,
as that of making laws for speaking.
While all men are upon a footing and no
singularities are accounted vulgar or ridiculous,
every man enjoys perfect liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
But when a particular set of men, in exalted
stations, undertake to say, "we are
the standards of propriety and elegance,
and if all men do not conform to our practice,
they shall be accounted vulgar and
ignorant," they take a very great liberty
with the rules of the language and the
rights of civility.</p>

<p>But an attempt to fix a standard on the
practice of any particular class of people is
highly absurd: As a friend of mine once
observed, it is like fixing a light house on
a floating island. It is an attempt to <i>fix</i>
that which is in itself <i>variable</i>; at least it
must be variable so long as it is supposed
that a local practice has no standard but a
<i>local practice</i>; that is, no standard but <i>itself</i>.
While this doctrine is believed, it
will be impossible for a nation to follow as
fast as the standard changes&mdash;for if the
gentlemen at court constitute a standard,
they are above it themselves, and their
practice must shift with their passions and
their whims.</p>

<p>But this is not all. If the practice of a
few men in the capital is to be the standard,
a knowlege of this must be communicated
to the whole nation. Who shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
do this? An able compiler perhaps attempts
to give this practice in a dictionary;
but it is probable that the pronunciation,
even at court, or on the stage, is not
uniform. The compiler therefore must
follow his particular friends and patrons;
in which case he is sure to be opposed and
the authority of his standard called in
question; or he must give two pronunciations
as the standard, which leaves the
student in the same uncertainty as it found
him. Both these events have actually taken
place in England, with respect to the
most approved standards; and of course
no one is universally followed.</p>

<p>Besides, if language must vary, like
fashions, at the caprice of a court, we must
have our standard dictionaries republished,
with the fashionable pronunciation, at least
once in five years; otherwise a gentleman
in the country will become intolerably vulgar,
by not being in a situation to adopt
the fashion of the day. The <i>new</i> editions
of them will supersede the <i>old</i>, and we shall
have our pronunciation to relearn, with
the polite alterations, which are generally
corruptions.</p>

<p>Such are the consequences of attempting
to make a <i>local</i> practice the <i>standard</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
language in a <i>nation</i>. The attempt must
keep the language in perpetual fluctuation,
and the learner in uncertainty.</p>

<p>If a standard therefore cannot be fixed
on local and variable custom, on what shall
it be fixed? If the most eminent speakers
are not to direct our practice, where shall
we look for a guide? The answer is extremely
easy; the <i>rules of the language itself</i>,
and the <i>general practice of the nation</i>,
constitute propriety in speaking. If we
examin the structure of any language,
we shall find a certain principle of analogy
running through the whole. We shall find
in English that similar combinations of
letters have usually the same pronunciation;
and that words, having the same terminating
syllable, generally have the accent
at the same distance from that termination.
These principles of analogy were not the
result of design&mdash;they must have been the
effect of accident, or that tendency which
all men feel towards uniformity.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>the principles, when established, are productive
of great convenience, and become
an authority superior to the arbitrary decisions
of any man or class of men. There
is one exception only to this remark: When
a deviation from analogy has become the
universal practice of a nation, it then takes
place of all rules and becomes the standard
of propriety.</p>

<p>The two points therefore, which I conceive
to be the basis of a standard in speaking,
are these; <i>universal undisputed practice</i>,
and the <i>principle of analogy</i>. <i>Universal
practice</i> is generally, perhaps always, a
rule of propriety; and in disputed points,
where people differ in opinion and practice,
<i>analogy</i> should always decide the controversy.</p>

<p>These are authorities to which all men
will submit&mdash;they are superior to the o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>pinions
and caprices of the great, and to
the negligence and ignorance of the multitude.
The authority of individuals is
always liable to be called in question&mdash;but
the unanimous consent of a nation, and a
fixed principle interwoven with the very
construction of a language, coeval and coextensive
with it, are like the common laws
of a land, or the immutable rules of morality,
the propriety of which every man,
however refractory, is forced to acknowlege,
and to which most men will readily
submit. Fashion is usually the child of
caprice and the being of a day; principles
of propriety are founded in the very nature
of things, and remain unmoved and unchanged,
amidst all the fluctuations of human
affairs and the revolutions of time.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that languages are
changing, from age to age, in proportion
to improvements in science. Words, as
Horace observes, are like leaves of trees;
the old ones are dropping off and new ones
growing. These changes are the necessary
consequence of changes in customs, the introduction
of new arts, and new ideas in
the sciences. Still the body of a language
and its general rules remain for ages the
same, and the new words usually conform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to these rules; otherwise they stand as exceptions,
which are not to overthrow the
principle of analogy already established.</p>

<p>But when a language has arrived at a
certain stage of improvement, it must be
stationary or become retrograde; for improvements
in science either cease, or become
slow and too inconsiderable to affect
materially the tone of a language. This
stage of improvement is the period when a
nation abounds with writers of the first
class, both for abilities and taste. This
period in England commenced with the
age of Queen Elizabeth and ended with
the reign of George II. It would have
been fortunate for the language, had the
stile of writing and the pronunciation of
words been fixed, as they stood in the reign
of Queen Anne and her successor. Few
improvements have been made since that
time; but innumerable corruptions in
pronunciation have been introduced by
Garrick, and in stile, by Johnson, Gibbon
and their imitators.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>The great Sidney wrote in a pure stile;
yet the best models of purity and elegance,
are the works of Sir William Temple, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Middleton, Lord Bolingbroke, Mr. Addison
and Dean Swift. But a little inferior
to these, are the writings of Mr. Pope, Sir
Richard Steele, Dr. Arbuthnot, with some
of their cotemporaries. Sir William Blackstone
has given the law stile all the elegance
and precision of which it is capable.
Dr. Price and Dr. Priestley write with purity,
and Sir William Jones seems to have
copied the ease, simplicity and elegance of
Middleton and Addison.</p>

<p>But how few of the modern writers
have pursued the same manner of writing?
Johnson's stile is a mixture of Latin and
English; an intolerable composition of
Latinity, affected smoothness, scholastic accuracy
and roundness of periods. The benefits
derived from his morality and his erudition,
will hardly counterbalance the mischief
done by his manner of writing. The
names of a Robertson, a Hume, a Home
and a Blair, almost silence criticism; but
I must repeat what a very learned Scotch
gentleman once acknowleged to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
"that the Scotch writers are not models of
the pure English stile." Their stile is
generally stiff, sometimes very awkward,
and not always correct.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Robertson labors
his stile and sometimes introduces a
word merely for the sake of rounding a
period. Hume has borrowed French idioms
without number; in other respects
he has given an excellent model of historical
stile. Lord Kaims' manner is stiff;
and Dr Blair, whose stile is less exceptionable
in these particulars, has however introduced,
into his writings, several foreign
idioms and ungrammatical phrases. The
Scotch writers now stand almost the first
for erudition; but perhaps no man can
write a foreign language with genuin purity.</p>

<p>Gibbon's harmony of prose is calculated
to delight our ears; but it is difficult to
comprehend his meaning and the chain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>his ideas, as fast as we naturally read; and
almost impossible to recollect them, at any
subsequent period. Perspicuity, the first
requisite in stile, is sometimes sacrificed to
melody; the mind of a reader is constantly
dazzled by a glare of ornament, or charmed
from the subject by the music of the language.
As he is one of the <i>first</i>, it is hoped
he may be the <i>last</i>, to attempt the gratification
of our <i>ears</i>, at the expense of our
<i>understanding</i>.</p>

<p>Such however is the taste of the age;
simplicity of stile is neglected for ornament,
and sense is sacrificed to sound.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>Altho stile, or the choice of words
and manner of arranging them, may be
necessarily liable to change, yet it does not
follow that pronunciation and orthography
cannot be rendered in a great measure permanent.
An orthography, in which there
would be a perfect correspondence between
the spelling and pronunciation, would go
very far towards effecting this desireable
object. The Greek language suffered little
or no change in these particulars, for about
a thousand years; and the Roman was in
a great degree fixed for several centuries.</p>

<p>Rapid changes of language proceed from
violent causes; but these causes cannot be
supposed to exist in North America. It is
contrary to all rational calculation, that the
United States will ever be conquered by
any one nation, speaking a different language
from that of the country. Removed
from the danger of corruption by conquest,
our language can change only with
the slow operation of the causes before-mentioned
and the progress of arts and
sciences, unless the folly of imitating our
parent country should continue to govern
us, and lead us into endless innovation.
This folly however will lose its influence
gradually, as our particular habits of re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>spect
for that country shall wear away, and
our <i>amor patri&aelig;</i> acquire strength and inspire
us with a suitable respect for our own
national character.</p>

<p>We have therefore the fairest opportunity
of establishing a national language,
and of giving it uniformity and perspicuity,
in North America, that ever presented
itself to mankind. Now is the time to begin
the plan. The minds of the Americans
are roused by the events of a revolution;
the necessity of organizing the political
body and of forming constitutions of
government that shall secure freedom and
property, has called all the faculties of the
mind into exertion; and the danger of
losing the benefits of independence, has
disposed every man to embrace any scheme
that shall tend, in its future operation, to
reconcile the people of America to each
other, and weaken the prejudices which
oppose a cordial union.</p>

<p>My design, in these dissertations, is critically
to investigate the rules of pronunciation
in our language; to examin the past and
present practice of the English, both in the
pronunciation of words and construction
of sentences; to exhibit the principal dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>ferences
between the practice in England
and America, and the differences in the
several parts of America, with a view to
reconcile them on the principles of <i>universal
practice</i> and <i>analogy</i>. I have no system
of my own to offer; my sole design is to
explain what I suppose to be authorities,
superior to all private opinions, and to examin
local dialects by those authorities.</p>

<p>Most writers upon this subject have
split upon one rock: They lay down certain
rules, arbitrary perhaps or drawn from
the principles of other languages, and then
condemn all English phrases which do not
coincide with those rules. They seem not
to consider that grammar is formed on
language, and not language on grammar.
Instead of examining to find what the English
language <i>is</i>, they endeavor to show
what it <i>ought to be</i> according to their rules.
It is for this reason that some of the criticisms
of the most celebrated philologers
are so far from being just, that they tend
to overthrow the rules, and corrupt the true
idiom, of the English tongue. Several examples
of this will appear in the course of
these Dissertations.</p>

<p>To learn the English language in its purity,
it is necessary to examin and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>pare
the best authors from Chaucer to the
present time. In executing the following
work, the most approved compilations
have been consulted, and the opinions of
the learned authors considered as respectable,
not as decisive, authorities. The language
itself has been examined with great
industry, with a view to discover and defend
its principles on the best grounds,
<i>analogies in structure</i>, and <i>immemorial usage</i>.
I have had recourse to the works of authors
who wrote prior to Chaucer, and
have even borrowed some light upon this
subject, from the early ages of Gothic ignorance.
Believing, with the author of
"Diversions of Purley," that the peculiar
structure of our language is Saxon, and
that its principles can be discovered only
in its Teutonic original, it has been my
business, as far as the materials in my
possession would permit, to compare the
English with the other branches of the
same stock, particularly the German and
the Danish. These researches have thrown
light upon the meaning and construction
of particular phrases, and enabled me to
vindicate some expressions in the language
which are often used, but generally condemned
by grammarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>My knowlege of the practice of speaking
in different parts of America, is derived
from personal observation. My knowlege
of the past and present state of the language
in England, is taken from the writers
who have treated expressly of the subject.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The authorities necessary to prove
particular points will be quoted, as occasion
shall require.</p>

<p>The talk of examining words cannot be
agreeable to a writer, nor can his criticisms
be very entertaining to the reader. Yet
this talk I have imposed upon myself; for
I believe it the only method to correct
common mistakes. A general rule may
be sufficient for a classical scholar, who
makes it his business to apply the rule to
all cases: But most readers must have their
particular errors laid before their eyes, or
they will not discover them.</p>

<p>To offer to correct the mistakes of others,
is also a <i>hazardous</i> task, and commonly exposes
a man to abuse and ill will. To avoid
this I can only say, that my motives for the
undertaking were not local nor personal; my
enquiries are for truth, and my criticisms,
it is hoped, will be marked with candor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>But before I proceed to explain the
principles of pronunciation, it is necessary
to give a sketch of the history of our language
from the earliest times, and endeavor
to discover from what sources it is derived.</p>


<h3>HISTORY <i>of the</i> ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p>The first correct accounts we have of
Britain were given by Julius Cesar, who invaded
and conquered the southern parts of
the island, about fifty four years before the
Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Tacitus, in his <i>Life of
Julius Agricola</i>, has described the natives
of the island, and given it as his opinion,
that they came from Gaul (now France.)
The inhabitants of Caledonia, now Scotland,
in the color of their hair and size of
their limbs, resembled the Germans. Some
appearances in the people of the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>southern parts of the island, and their position
with respect to Spain, indicated <i>their</i>
descent from the ancient Iberi. But those
who inhabited the shores, opposite to
France, resembled the Gauls, in their religious
ceremonies, their courage, and particularly
in their language: "Sermo haud
multum diversus."<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It is an uncontroverted point, that the
primitive language of Britain was the
same as that of Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This language
was denominated the Celtic, from the <i>Celt&aelig;</i>,
or <i>Kelt&aelig;</i>, a famous tribe of people that
inhabited Gaul. Many writers suppose the
Celtic to have been the primitive elementary
language, from which most, or all
the present languages of Europe, and some
of the languages of Asia and Africa, are
derived. Some authors go so far as to assert
that the Greek and Roman may be
traced to the same source. To prove this
opinion well founded, they endeavor to
discover an affinity between these languages,
by analizing words in each, and tracing
them to the same elements or monosyllabic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>roots. In this they have succeeded so
far as to discover a great number of words,
which, with small dialectical variations,
are common to the Greek and Latin
and to most of the living languages of
Europe. Perhaps these radicals, common
to all languages of which we have any
knowlege, were sufficient to form a simple
language, adequate to the purposes of
speech among rude nations.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>But as the first inhabitants of the earth
had, for many ages, no method of fixing
sounds, or very imperfect methods, their
language must have been liable to considerable
mutations, even when they lived and
conversed together. But after they had
separated from each other, by extending
their settlements into distant regions, and
an intercourse between the colonies had
ceased, their languages must have in a great
measure lost their affinity to each other.
The radical words, common to all, must
have assumed dialectical distinctions, and
new objects and inventions, peculiar to the
different tribes, must have originated new
terms among each, to which the others
were strangers. Different nations would
advance, by very different degrees of rapidity,
to a state of civilization, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
words multiply with ideas, one language
would become more copious than another,
as well as more regular and polished. In
the course of many centuries, these causes
would obscure the common radicals, and
make such accessions of new words to each
dialect, as to form them all into distinct
languages. An uncivilized people have
occasion for few words; perhaps five or
six hundred would answer all their purposes.
And if we should thoroughly examin
any of the present languages of the
world, we should probably find that the
roots of the most copious do not amount
to more than that number. The Greek,
it is said, may be traced to about three or
four hundred radical words. These roots
or elementary words are usually monosyllables,
and mostly names of sensible objects.
By applying these names figuratively,
savages make them answer the purpose
of expressing other ideas, and by combining
them in an almost infinite variety of
ways, civilized nations form copious and
elegant languages.</p>

<p>Thus it happens that in the existing
languages of Europe, there are many words
evidently the same; the orthography and
pronunciation do not exactly coincide in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the countries where they are used; yet the
resemblance is obvious in <i>these</i> particulars;
and with respect to their <i>meaning</i>, there is
such an affinity, as to demonstrate that
the nations, in whose languages they are
found, all sprung from the same parents.</p>

<p>The primitive language of Europe probably
retained its original form and purity in
the West, much later than on the borders of
Asia;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for the Gauls and Britons had made
less advances in knowlege, than the eastern
nations, and had probably suffered
fewer shocks from war and conquest. The
Greeks first formed an elegant language
out of the barbarous dialects spoken on
the borders of the Egean Sea. The Romans
afterwards did the same in Italy, and
gradually changed the languages of the
countries which they conquered, by introducing
their own. It was the policy of
the Roman state to make <i>subjects</i>, rather
than <i>slaves</i>, of their conquered nations;
and the introduction of their own tongue
among them was considered as a necessary
step towards removing prejudices, facilitating
an intercourse with their provinces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>reconciling distant nations to the Roman
government.</p>

<p>Julius Cesar found the Gauls and
Britons at peace, united by a similarity of
manners and language, and by a sameness
of interest. His conquest of their countries
made some inroads upon their language.
But altho the Romans had possession
of these countries more than four
hundred years, during which time Roman
garrisons were stationed in Gaul and Britain,
the young men of both countries were
drafted into the Roman service, and many
British youth went to Rome for an education, still
the native Celtic language remained
without material alteration. It is obvious
indeed that many of the higher classes of
people were acquainted with Latin, and
there are traces of that language still found
among the Welsh, the descendants of the
ancient Britons. But the body of the people,
either for want of opportunity to learn
the Latin, or thro an inveterate hatred of
their conquerors, continued wedded to
their native tongue. This would have still
been the language of France and England,
had it not suffered more violent shocks,
than by the Roman conquests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the fifth century, the southern
parts of Europe began to be alarmed by
the invasion of the Goths, Vandals, Huns
and other fierce barbarians from the North.
For three centuries, all the fertile provinces
of the Roman empire were ravaged
by these hardy invaders, the most of whom
settled in the countries which they conquered.</p>

<p>These nations, mixing with the natives
of the country where they settled, changed
or corrupted the primitive language. From
the jargon of Celtic and Roman, blended
with the language of the Franks, Normans,
Burgundians, &amp;c. sprung the modern
French. From the mixture of Latin,
with the language of the Huns, Lombards,
&amp;c. sprung the present Italian. From a
similar composition of Latin, with the language
of the Visigoths and other northern
tribes, and some remains of the Moorish
language, left in Spain by the Saracens,
are formed the modern Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>In the general desolation, occasioned by
these conquests, the island of Britain did
not escape. The Saxons, a tribe of northern
nations, which inhabited the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>try
now called Denmark, or the shores
of the Baltic, now within the Empire of
Germany, invaded Britain, soon after the
Roman legions had been called home to
defend the Empire against other tribes of
barbarians. It is said the Saxons were at
first invited to assist the Britons against the
inroads of the Picts or Scots, and that having
defeated the invaders, they were tempted,
by the fertility of the soil, to remain
in the island, and afterwards took possession
of it for themselves.</p>

<p>But whatever was the first cause of their
leaving their native country, it is certain,
that numerous bodies of adventurers, at
different times, went over and seated themselves
in the island. They did not cease
till they had possessed themselves of all the
fertile and cultivated parts of England.
The universality of the conquest is demonstrated
by the total change of language;
there being no more affinity between the
Saxon or English, and the ancient British,
than between any two languages of Europe.</p>

<p>The British however was not lost. The
brave inhabitants, who survived the liberty
of their country, and could not brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the idea of living with their conquerors,
retired to the countries within the mountains
on the west of the island, now called
<i>Wales</i> and <i>Cornwall</i>, where they maintained
their independence for many centuries,
and where their language is still preserved.
The Welsh and the Cornish therefore are
the purest remains of the primitive Celtic
language.</p>

<p>To these we may add the Armoric, or
language of the Bas Breton, on the coast
of France; the inhabitants of which are
genuin descendants of the old Britons.
The time and occasion of this settlement in
France are not certain. Perhaps a body
of Britons were driven thither by the Saxon
conquest of England; or what is more
probable, as it is a tradition among the
people, the Armoricans are the posterity
of some British soldiers, who had been in
the Roman army when it was called to Italy
to defend the empire, and on their return,
being informed that the Saxons had
taken possession of their native country,
seated themselves on the opposite coast of
France.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>But whatever was the cause of the settlement,
the language of the people is the
old British or Celtic; for altho they must
have been separated from their countrymen
about twelve or fourteen hundred
years, yet there is such an affinity still between
the Welsh and the Armoric, that
the Welsh soldiers, who passed thro Brittany
in a late war,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> could converse familiarly
with the inhabitants. If any other
proof than this were necessary to convince
the reader, we might mention the name of
this province, <i>Brittany</i>, and produce a long
catalogue of Armoric words, collated with
the Welsh and Cornish.</p>

<p>One would think that the Irish, by reason
of their vicinity to England, would have
spoken the same language; yet it is found
that the old Irish tongue has very little affinity
with the Welsh. Sir William Temple
asserts<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that the Erse, or Caledonian
language, and the old Irish, which are radically
the same, and spoken also on the Isle
of Man, have no affinity with any other
language now spoken. But the celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>Lluyd and others, who have been more
critical in their investigations of this subject,
maintain that the Irish has a real affinity
with the Cambrian or British. They
further show that many names of places
in S. Britain, the meaning of which is lost in
the Welsh, can be explained only by words
now extant in the Irish and Erse. This
is a sufficient proof of a common origin.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>But on this point historians are divided
in opinion. Some suppose that the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>of Ireland was first peopled by emigrations
from Scotland, and the sameness of their
language renders this opinion probable.
But whence do the Scots derive their origin?
The most probable account of the
settlement of Scotland is, that it was peopled
from Norway or some other northern
country, by a tribe of those nations that
went under the general denomination of
<i>Scythians</i>; for <i>Scot</i> and <i>Scythian</i> are from
the same root.</p>

<p>There are writers, however, who contend
that Ireland must have been settled
from Spain, for there are many Spanish
words found in the language of the country.
But the number of these is too inconsiderable
to render the argument conclusive.</p>

<p>Within a few years, an attempt has
been made to trace the origin of the Irish
nation, to the Carthaginians. The author
of a small work, entitled "An Essay
on the Antiquities of Ireland," has examined,
in a play of Plautus, the Punic speech
which has the marks of being the genuin
language of Carthage, and has collated it
with the ancient Irish. In this speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
there is a surprising affinity between the
languages.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>But without running into a field of
conjecture, it is sufficient for my purpose
to observe, that the Irish, the Erse, and the
language spoken on the Isle of Man, are
indisputably the same, and must have been
very ancient: That the Welsh, the Cornish,
and the Armoric are now a distinct
language, and unquestionably the remains
of the Celtic, or that language which was
common to Gaul and Britain, when they
were invaded by Julius Cesar. The Irish
and the British may be as distinct as the
Hebrew and the British, and yet a critical
etymologist may discover in both, common
radicals enough to convince him that both
are the offspring of the same parent.</p>

<p>Hitherto our researches have thrown
but little light upon the present English
language. For the substance of this we
must look to the Saxon branch of the Teutonic.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>The Teutones and Goths or Get&aelig; were
the nations that inhabited the north of
Europe. They were in a rude state and
had no historical records by which their descent
could be ascertained. They however
had a class of men under the denomination
of <i>Scalds</i> or <i>Bards</i>, whose business it
was to recount in verse the illustrious actions
of their heroes, and to preserve their
traditions. These <i>Scalds</i> all agree that
their ancestors came from the east;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
it is well known also that Herodotus mentions
the <i>Germans</i> as a Persian people.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It is probable that they extended their settlements
gradually, or were driven from
Asia by the Roman invasions under Pompey,
during the reign of Mithridates, and
under the conduct of Odin, their hero and
lawgiver, established themselves on the
shores of the Baltic.</p>

<p>From these nations proceeded those fierce
and numerous warriors, who, under different
leaders invaded and subdued all the
southern parts of Europe; changed the
government, the manners and the language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>of the primitive inhabitants, and gave them
their present complexion. The Saxons,
who inhabited the northern parts of Germany,
or Denmark, were the tribe that
conquered England, and introduced a language
and a form of government, the principles
of which are still existent among
their descendants, both in England and America.
This happened in the fifth and
sixth centuries.</p>

<p>Our language is therefore derived from
the same stock as the German, the Dutch,
the Danish, the Swedish, and the Swiss.
Of all these branches, the German is perhaps
the principal, and that which has suffered
the least by the violence of conquest
or the changes of time. Between this and
the pure English, there is a close affinity,
as may be observed by any person indifferently
well acquainted with both.</p>

<p>From the establishment of the Saxons
in England, to the Norman conquest, the
language of the country suffered but little
variation. The invasions of the Danes and
their government of the kingdom, during
a short period, could not but affect the
language, yet not materially, as the island
suffered a change of masters, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of people or laws; and indeed the Danes
themselves spoke a dialect of the Saxon
language.</p>

<p>But the conquest by William, the Norman,
in 1066, introduced important changes
into the language, as well as the government
of the English nation. William was
followed by multitudes of his countrymen;
these formed his court, and filled the rich
livings, temporal and ecclesiastical, which
were forfeited or left vacant by the death
of their former possessors who were slain in
the battle of Hastings. The language of
the conquerors, which was a mixture of
Latin and Norman, immediately became
fashionable at Court, and was used in all
legislative and judicial proceedings. It
continued to be the polite and law language
of the nation about three centuries; when,
in the thirty sixth year of Edward III.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> an
act of parliament was passed, ordaining
that in future all pleas in courts should be
made in English and recorded in Latin.
In the preamble to this act, the reason assigned
for making it is, "that the people
of the realm did not understand French."<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>This proves that the Norman French
was spoken only by the nobility, who were
mostly of Norman extraction, and by the
higher orders of men in office, at court, or
in the cities. The body of the people, defendants
of the Saxons, still retained their
primitive tongue.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> During this period,
when French was the polite, and Saxon
the vulgar language of the English, the
Latin was also understood by the learned,
who were mostly the regular and secular
clergy. On the revival of literature in
Europe, Latin was studied with classical
correctness, and the number and excellence
of the Greek and Roman authors, with
the elegance of the languages, have recommended
them to the attention of succeeding
generations. The records of parliament
and of judicial proceedings were kept in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Latin, from the thirty sixth of Edward III.
to the fourth of George II.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> when, by act
of parliament, the <i>English</i> was ordered to
be the language of the <i>English</i> laws and
public records. Of these three languages,
the Saxon, the Norman French and the
Latin, our present English is composed.</p>

<p>The incorporation of the Roman and
other foreign tongues with the English,
took place principally under the first Norman
kings. It was attended with some
difficulty, and Chaucer has been censured
by his cotemporaries for introducing cartloads
of French words into his writings.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Language is the effect of necessity,
and when a nation has a language which
is competent to all their purposes of communicating
ideas, they will not embrace
new words and phrases. This is the reason
why the yeomanry of the English nation
have never adopted the improvements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>of the English tongue. The Saxon was
competent to most of the purposes of an
agricultural people; and the class of men
who have not advanced beyond that state,
which in fact makes the body of the nation,
at least in America, seldom use any
words except those of Saxon original.</p>

<p>But as men proceed in the progress of
society, their ideas multiply, and new words
are necessary to express them. They must
therefore either invent words, or combine
those before used into compounds, or borrow
words of suitable import from a foreign
language. The latter method was
principally pursued by the English. The
learned of the nation spoke and wrote Latin,
which had been the language of a polite
and improved nation, and consequently
abounds with terms in the various arts
and sciences. When the English found
their native tongue deficient, they had recourse
to the Roman or Greek, where they
were immediately supplied with words, expressive
of their new ideas, and easily conforming
to the genius of the English language.</p>

<p>The English retained its Saxon appearance
till the twelfth century.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
period to Chaucer, who wrote in the reign
of Edward III. about the year 1360 or 70,
the changes were slow and gradual. Chaucer
was a man of a very liberal education;
well versed in the Greek and Roman authors;
and his mind had been improved by
his travels. His genius and acquirements
led him to stray from the common stile of
writing, and enrich his verse with the elegance
of the <i>Proven&ccedil;al</i> language, at that
time the most polished in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> His
abilities, his reputation and his influence
at court, enabled him, in opposition to
his adversaries, to introduce many beauties
and much energy into our language.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>From Chaucer to Addison our language
was progressively refined, and enriched
with a variety of words, adequate to all
its uses among a people highly improved.
The French language has furnished us with
military terms; the Dutch with sea phrases;
the Greek and Roman with words proper to
form and polish the poetical, historical and
rhetorical stiles, and with terms in mathematics,
philosophy and physic; the modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Italian has supplied us with terms in
music, painting and sculpture; and in the
Saxon, the ground-work of the whole, the
yeomanry find all the words for which
they have any use in domestic life or in
the agricultural and most simple mechanical
employments.</p>

<p>In this progress, the language has not only
been enriched with a copious supply
of words, but the accent of words has generally
been established in such a manner
as to render pronunciation melodious.
The spoken language is also softened, by an
omission of the harsh and guttural sounds
which originally belonged to the language,
and which are still retained by the Germans,
Scotch and Dutch. At the same
time, it is not, like the French, enervated
by a loss of consonants. It holds a mean
between the harshness of the German, and
the feebleness of the French. It has more
smoothness and fluency than the northern
languages, and less music in its vocal
sounds, than the Spanish and Italian. As
the English have attempted every branch
of science, and generally proceeded farther
in their improvements than other nations,
so their language is proportionably copious
and expressive.</p>

<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>Having given this general history and
the present state of the language, I proceed
to some remarks that naturally result from
the subject.</p>

<p>1. The primitive language of the English
nation was the Saxon, and the words
derived from that, now constitute the
ground-work of modern English. Hence
all the rules of inflection, and most of the
rules of construction, are Saxon. The plural
terminations of nouns, the variations
of the pronouns, the endings which mark
the comparison of adjectives, and the inflections
of the verbs, are wholly of Teutonic
origin. For this reason, the rules
of grammatical construction and the propriety
of particular phrases, can be ascertained
only by the ancient Saxon, and the
modern English writings. The Greek and
Roman languages were constructed on different
principles, which circumstance has
not been sufficiently attended to, by those
who have attempted to compile English
Grammars. The consequence is, that
false principles have been introduced and
taught as the rules of the English lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>guage,
by which means very eminent writers
have been led into mistakes.</p>

<p>2. It has been remarked that the common
people, descendants of the Saxons,
use principally words derived from the native
language of their ancestors, with few
derivatives from the foreign tongues, for
which they have no occasion. This fact
suggests the impropriety of writing sermons,
or other discourses designed for general
use, in the elevated English stile. To
adapt a stile to common capacities, the
language should consist, as much as possible,
of Saxon words, or of Latin and French
derivatives which are introduced into familiar
discourse. The modern taste for introducing
uncommon words into writings,
for rounding periods, and rising into what
is falsely called the elegant and sublime stile,
has had an unhappy effect in rendering
language obscure or unintelligible.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>3. The number and perfection of the
languages from which the English is collected,
must account for its copiousness and
the multitude of synonimous words with
which it abounds.</p>

<p>A primitive unmixed language rarely
contains two words of the same signification.
On the contrary, rude nations often
use one word to express several ideas, which
have some resemblance or analogy to each
other, in the constitution of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>From the poverty of a language proceed
repetitions of the same word, to express
an idea with particular force, or in the
superlative degree. Hence the Hebraisms,
as they are called, of the Bible; to <i>rejoice</i>
with <i>joy</i>; to <i>fear</i> with great <i>fear</i>. This
mode of speaking is frequent among all
nations whose languages are imperfect.</p>

<p>But the English, on the other hand, abounds
with synonimous terms, so that a
repetition of <i>words</i> is generally unnecessary,
even when there is a necessity of repeating
the <i>idea</i> in the same sentence.</p>

<p>This copiousness, while it affords great
advantages to a judicious writer, may also
be abused, and become the cause of a prolix
verbose stile. Instances of this fault
occur in almost every author; it is one
of the greatest, as well as most frequent
faults in writing, and yet has scarcely been
censured by critics.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>There are indeed but few instances in
which two or three words express <i>precisely</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>the same idea; but there are many instances
of words conveying <i>nearly</i> the same sense,
which are thrown together by careless
writers without the least occasion. Take
for example a passage of Mr. Addison's
Cato:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So the <i>pure</i>, <i>limpid</i> stream, when <i>foul</i> with <i>stains</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rushing torrents and descending rains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Works</i> itself <i>clear</i> and as it runs <i>refines</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till by degrees the floating mirror shines."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Pure</i> and <i>limpid</i> are here too nearly synonimous
to be applied to the same object.
The same objection lies to the use of "<i>foul</i>
with <i>stains</i>." Between <i>working clear</i> and
<i>refining</i>, there is perhaps no difference in
idea: And the arrangement in the second
line is objectionable, for the consequence
is placed before the cause; <i>rushing torrents</i>
being the consequence of <i>descending rains</i>.
Such an assemblage of synonimous words
clogs and enfeebles the expression, and fatigues
the mind of the reader. Writers
of an inferior class are particularly fond of
crowding together epithets. If they would
describe a man they hate, he is a <i>low</i>, <i>vile</i>,
<i>mean</i>, <i>despicable</i>, <i>contemptible</i> fellow. If
they would describe a man of an amiable
character, he is the most <i>kind</i>, <i>humane</i>, <i>loving</i>,
<i>tender</i>, <i>affectionate</i> being imaginable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Epithets, so liberally bestowed, confuse our
ideas and leave the mind without any distinct
knowlege of the character.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>To a copiousness of language, on the
other hand, may be ascribed the decline
of action in speaking, and the want of animation.
When nations have but few
words to express their ideas, they have recourse to
figures, to significant tones, looks
and gestures, to supply the defect. Hence
the figurative language of the Orientals of
antiquity; hence the imagery of the Caledonian
Bard;<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the bold metaphorical language
of the American natives, and the
expressive tones and gesticulations that attend
their speaking.</p>

<p>To this cause also must we ascribe the
music of the Greek language, and the action
which accompanied the rehearsals on
the stage. What was the effect of necessity
at first, became afterwards a matter of
art. This was the origin of the pantomime.
Modern operas are also an imitation
of the ancient musical rehearsals of
the theater.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>But as languages become rich and furnish
words for communicating every idea,
action must naturally cease. Men will not
give themselves the pain of exerting their
limbs and body to make themselves understood,
when a bare opening of their lips
will answer the purpose. This may be
assigned as one principal cause of the decline
of eloquence in modern ages, particularly
among the English.</p>

<p>To the same cause, in part, may we ascribe
the difference in the French and English
manner of speaking. It is a common
observation, that the French use more action
and are more animated in conversation,
than the English. The cause usually
assigned, is, the natural vivacity of the
French nation; which appears to me not
satisfactory; for the Germans, who resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>ble
the French, in some degree, in their
manner of speaking, are nevertheless a
more grave people than the English.</p>

<p>I suspect that the difference may in
part be thus accounted for. The French,
tho by no means a barren language, wants
words to express many ideas, for which the
English is provided. For example, the
English has two forms for the future tense
of verbs; <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>; each of which
has a distinct meaning. <i>Shall</i> expresses
event in the first person, and promise,
command or threatning in the second and
third. <i>Will</i>, in the first person, promises;
in the second and third, foretells. The
French has no such distinction. The
phrase <i>je lui payerai</i>, the only form of the
future, cannot convey such distinct meanings,
as <i>promise</i> and <i>event</i>, unless accompanied
with some expressive tone or gesture.
A Frenchman therefore, to express the force
of the English, <i>I will pay</i>, must supply the
want of a distinct word by action, or have
recourse to a circumlocution. The same
remark holds with respect to <i>would</i> and
<i>should</i>, which, in a variety of combinations,
retain distinct significations.</p>

<p>The French has properly but one word,
<i>plume</i>, for the three English words, <i>feather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
en</i> and <i>quill</i>. Its verbs have not such a
variety of combinations to express the precise
time of an action as the English. <i>J'ecris</i>
is the only phrase for the English, <i>I
write</i> and <i>I am writing</i>, which have distinct
uses; and I do not know whether there is
any phrase used in French which will exactly
correspond with the English phrases
answering to the inceptive verb of the Romans,
<i>I am going to write</i>, or, <i>am about
writing</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This solution of a difficulty, which has
occurred to many people, in comparing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>manners of the English and French, may
not be the true one; but it appears rational.
Other causes also have a material
influence upon eloquence, particularly the
form of government and the state of society.
In these respects England and France
may not be so favorable to the cultivation
of oratory, as were the republics of Greece
and Rome. But if a free government is
the best soil for the growth of eloquence,
why should it flourish in France rather
than in England, which is said to be the
fact with respect to pulpit eloquence? The
genius of the nation may have its effect;
but it is presumed, the state of the language
may be considered as an auxiliary
cause, if not a principal.</p>

<p>From the foregoing history of the language,
we learn the causes of its incorrect
orthography. The Saxon characters, some
of which were Roman, both in shape and
power, while others were peculiar to the
language, continued in use till the fourteenth
century. These were afterwards laid
aside for the Old English characters, as they
are usually called; which were introduced
with the art of printing from Germany,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>and continued in use, till within a century.
But both the Saxon and German letters
were much inferior to the Roman in the
simplicity and elegance of their form; for
which reason most of the European nations
have rejected their primitive characters
and adopted the Roman.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In changing the characters of an alphabet,
as well as in expressing the sounds of
one language by letters of an other, some
difficulty will often arise from the want of
a perfect correspondence between the true
sounds of letters in both. Altho there is,
and must be, a great uniformity in the articulate
sounds of all men, yet there are also
differences peculiar to each nation, which
others have not proper characters to express.</p>

<p>Thus the Romans, when they would
express the sound of the Greek &#952; and of
&#967;, for want of suitable characters, wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><i>th</i> and <i>ch</i>. We conclude from this circumstance,
that the Greek sound of the
former was that of <i>t</i> followed by an aspirate,
and the latter, that of <i>k</i> with an aspirate.
Yet it is very probable that the
sounds were guttural in Greek, and not
exactly represented by the Latin combinations
<i>th</i> and <i>ch</i>.</p>

<p>Thus two Saxon characters are represented
in modern English, by the Latin
combination <i>th</i>, as in <i>think</i>, <i>thou</i>. These
Saxon characters were single letters and
had distinct powers. We preserve the distinction
of sounds to this day, but are subject
to the inconvenience of having no
mark by which the eye can discern that
distinction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <i>sh</i> was usually written
by the Saxons <i>sc</i>, as <i>sceaft</i>, shaft; <i>sceam</i>,
shame; <i>sceal</i>, shall. What was the pronunciation
of <i>sc</i> cannot be determined;
but it is evident that each letter had a distinct
sound. It is most probable that before
<i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>, <i>sc</i> were pronounced <i>sk</i>, or
<i>c</i> might have had the force of <i>ch</i> in <i>choose</i>.
It is very clear that <i>c</i> had this sound before
<i>e</i> and <i>i</i>; for the Saxon words in which
<i>ch</i> now precede <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, were formerly spelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
with <i>c</i> only; as <i>child</i> from the Saxon <i>cild</i>; <i>chill</i>
from <i>cele</i>; <i>chink</i> from <i>cinnon</i>, to gape; <i>chick</i>
from <i>cicen</i>. If therefore <i>c</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> had
the force of <i>ch</i>, <i>sceaft</i> must have been pronounced
<i>scheaft</i>, which would easily be softened
down and contracted into <i>shaft</i>.</p>

<p>But whatever was the sound of <i>sc</i> in the
Saxon, the sound derived from it is now
simple, and has no single character to represent
it in our language; for the proper
sounds of <i>s</i> and <i>h</i> combined, do not form
the sound which we invariably annex to
<i>sh</i>. By not retaining the primitive Saxon
<i>c</i> after <i>s</i>, we have probably lost the pronunciation
and introduced an irregularity.</p>

<p>It is not certain however that a change
of the alphabet was prior to the change of
pronunciation; for the latter might have
produced the former. But the effect is
certain; we have a simple sound without
a proper character, which is always an imperfection.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>We have therefore in English the two
sounds of <i>th</i>, the aspirate in <i>think</i>, and the
vocal in <i>this</i>, both of which are simple consonant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>sounds, peculiar to the language,
and derived from two <i>single</i> characters.
Each ought still to be represented by a distinct
single letter. <i>Sh</i>, on the other hand,
express a simple sound, derived from <i>two</i>
separate Saxon consonants, which must
have been originally pronounced as two
letters. These irregularities must have
been partly owing to a change of alphabet.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Other irregularities have been occasioned
by an injudicious application of the
letters of one alphabet to the sounds of another
language.</p>

<p>The Roman <i>c</i> some writers suppose was
hard, like <i>k</i>, before all the vowels and diphthongs.
It certainly was so before all except
<i>e</i> and <i>i</i>; where, there is reason to suppose,
it had the sound of <i>ch</i> or <i>ts</i>. It is very evident
that it had not the sound of <i>s</i>, which
we now annex to it in <i>civil</i>, <i>cellar</i>. When
the Roman alphabet, therefore, took place
of the primitive English characters, the
Greek <i>k</i> should have been always written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, as in <i>cat</i>, <i>cord</i>, <i>cup</i>; and <i>s</i>
before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>. Or <i>c</i> should have been
called <i>ke</i>, limited to one sound, and always
used instead of <i>k</i>. If our ancestors had retained
the Roman pronunciation of <i>c</i> before
<i>e</i> and <i>i</i>, they would probably have
spelt <i>cera</i>, <i>civilis</i>, <i>chera</i>, <i>chivilis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>ch</i> having
its English sound of <i>tsh</i>, as in <i>charm</i>. But
if they pronounced these words as we do,
they should have substituted <i>s</i>, <i>sera</i>, <i>sivilis</i>.
In short, they should have limited every
character to one sound; in which case, one
of the three letters, <i>c</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>s</i>, would have been
entirely omitted as useless. This would
have delivered us from a large class of difficulties.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>ph</i> and <i>ch</i>, in Greek derivatives,
were originally introduced into
English, because our ancestors preserved
the aspirate; or whether the <i>h</i> was retained
merely to show the etymology of words,
it is not easy to decide. The probability
is, that these letters were never aspirated
in English, but that <i>ph</i> has ever been pronounced
<i>f</i>, and <i>ch</i> generally <i>k</i>; as in <i>Philip</i>,
<i>chorus</i>. It is probable however that the
Romans, from whom the English borrowed
their characters, preserved the aspirate;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>for they very scrupulously retained the <i>h</i>
after <i>p</i> and <i>c</i>; and they attempted to copy
exactly the Greek pronunciation.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> They
borrowed all words in <i>ph</i>, <i>ch</i> and <i>th</i> from
the Greeks. We have preserved the characters,
but have mostly lost the aspirate;
<i>ph</i> has invariably the sound of <i>f</i>; <i>ch</i>, in
Greek derivatives, generally that of <i>k</i>; and
<i>th</i> has become the representative of two
simple consonants. With this change of
pronunciation, the orthography should
have changed; <i>philosophy</i> should now be
written <i>filosofy</i>; and <i>chorus</i>, <i>korus</i>; <i>th</i> might
become a single character and be called
<i>Eth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>But it was the fate of our language to
be shaken by violent revolutions, and abandoned
to accident or the caprice of unskillful
heads. The operation of imperceptible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>causes, common to all languages,
in all ages, has also been gradually changing
the spelling and pronunciation.</p>

<p>In Chaucer's time, the infinitive mode
and plural number of verbs, in the present
tense, ended often in <i>en</i>; as <i>loven</i>, for <i>to
love</i> or <i>they love</i>. But <i>loveth</i> was sometimes
used in the plural, and <i>n</i> began to be
omitted in the infinitive. The French
termination <i>esse</i>, as in <i>Goddesse</i>, <i>richesse</i>, was
used, and the final <i>e</i> was often pronounced.
The plural number of nouns usually ended
in <i>es</i>, as <i>houndes</i>; and in the same manner
terminated the genitive case. Nouns
now ending in <i>y</i>, ended then in <i>ie</i>, as <i>storie</i>;
<i>y</i> was still prefixed to participles, as <i>ybent</i>;
and <i>y</i> was often used where we now write
<i>g</i>, as <i>yeve</i> for <i>give</i>.</p>

<p>From that period the orthography was
still varying, at least in some particulars,
till the beginning of the present century.
The group of eminent writers who
were cotemporary with Swift, gave great
stability to the spelling; yet some good authorities
differ from them in several points.
Johnson, who has been usually followed by
succeeding compilers of dictionaries, preserves
the <i>u</i> in <i>honour</i>, <i>favour</i>, and similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
words; as also the final <i>k</i> in <i>publick</i>, &amp;c.
Ash, followed by many writers, very properly
restores these words to the Roman spelling,
by omitting the <i>u</i> and <i>k</i>. Excepting
these particulars, the orthography of our
language is nearly fixed.</p>

<p>The pronunciation has been neglected
till a few years ago; when Sheridan and
Kenrick, with several compilers of less note,
attempted to give us a standard. Unluckily
they have all made the attempt on
false principles; and will, if followed,
multiply the anomalies, which already
deform the language and embarrass the
learner.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The language, is composed of a variety
of materials, and it requires some
labor to adjust the parts and reduce them
to order.</p>

<p>To accomplish this purpose, we must
search for such principles of analogy as
still exist in its construction, and make
them the pillars of a regular system. Where
such principles cannot be found, let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>examin the opinions of the learned, and
the practice of the nations which speak
the pure English, that we may determine
by the weight of authority, the <i>common law</i>
of language, those questions which do not
come within any established rules.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The progress of corruption in language is described with
precision, and philosophical reasons assigned with great
judgement, by that celebrated French writer, Condillac, in his
Origin of Human Knowlege, Part 2.
</p>
<p>
"It is nearly the same here as in physics, where motion,
the source of life, becomes the principle of destruction.
When a language abounds with original writers in every
kind, the more a person is endowed with abilities, the more
difficult he thinks it will be to surpass them. A mere equality
would not satisfy his ambition; like them he wants
the pre-eminence. He therefore tries a new road. But
as every stile analogous to the character of the language
and to his own, has been already used by preceding writers,
he has nothing left but to deviate from analogy. Thus in
order to be an original, he is obliged to contribute to the
ruin of a language, which, a century sooner, he would have
helped to improve.
</p>
<p>
"Tho such writers may be criticized, their superior
abilities must still command success. The ease there is in
copying their defects, soon persuades men of indifferent capacities,
that they shall acquire the same degree of reputation.
Then begins the reign of strained and subtle conceits,
of affected antitheses, of specious paradoxes, of frivolous
and far-fetched expressions, of new-fangled words,
and in short, of the jargon of persons, whose understandings
have been debauched by bad metaphysics. The public
applauds; foolish and ridiculous writings, the beings of
a day, are surprisingly multiplied; a vicious taste infects the
arts and sciences, which is followed by a visible decrease
of men of abilities."
</p>
<p>
One would think that Condillac had designed here to give
a description of the present taste of the English writers, and
a state of their literature.
</p>
<p>
The foregoing sentiments seem to have been borrowed
from Velleius Paterculus. Hist. Rom. L. 1. Cap. 17.
</p>
<p>
The same passage is copied by Sig. Carlo Denina, Professor
of Eloquence and Belles Lettres in the University of Turin,
in his "Revolutions of Literature," page 47; and if I mistake
not, the sentiments are adopted by Lord Kaims, in his
Sketches of the History of Man.
</p>
<p>
Similar reasons may be assigned for the prevalence of an
affected and vitious pronunciation.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Dr. Witherspoon is an exception. His stile is easy,
simple and elegant. I consider Dr. Franklin and Dr.
Witherspoon as the two best writers in America. The
words they use, and their arrangement, appear to flow spontaneously
from their manner of thinking. The vast superiority
of their stiles over those of Gibbon and Gillies, is owing
to this circumstance, that the two American writers
have bestowed their labor upon <i>ideas</i>, and the English historians
upon <i>words</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The same taste prevailed in Rome, under the Emperors,
when genius was prostituted to the mean purposes of
flattery. "It must be acknowleged indeed, that after the
dissolution of the Roman republic, this art began to be perverted
by being too much admired. Men grew excessively fond of
the numerous stile, and readily sacrificed the strength and
energy of their discourse to the harmony of their language.
Pliny the younger often complains of this contemptible affectation:
And Quintilian speaks of certain prose writers
in his time, who boasted that their compositions were so
strictly numerous, that their hearers might even beat time to
their measures. And it should seem that even in Tully's
time, this matter was carried to excess; since even then the
orators dealt so much in numbers, that it was made a question,
wherein they differed from the Poets."&mdash;&mdash;Mason's
Essay on the Power and Harmony of Prosaic Numbers.

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Indeed a good reason may be given for the apparent
difference in the several branches of the old Celtic. In this
language, words are declined by changing the initial letters,
or by prefixing an article with an apostrophe. By these
means, words are so altered, that a superficial observer may
confound the radical letters, with those which are added for
the sake of expressing different relations. Thus the British
word <i>pen</i> signifies, a head; <i>pen g&ucirc;r</i>, a man's head; <i>i ben</i>,
his head; <i>i phen</i>, her head; <i>y'm mhen</i>, my head. This by
the way is no contemptible evidence that the British was
derived from the Phenician or Hebrew, in the latter of
which, words are declined by prefixes, as well as suffixes.
</p>
<p>
For the difference between the Irish and British, Lluyd
assigns other reasons. The ancestors of the Irish and Highland
Scots, who were called Guydelians, might have been
the original Celts, who first inhabited Britain; and the
Cymri or Welsh, another race, or a branch of the Celtic
Cimbri, might, either by colonization or conquest, take possession
of Britain, and introduce a very different dialect of
the same radical language. The Irish language might be
somewhat changed by Cantabrian words, imported by the
Scots from Spain; and the Cymraeg or British might suffer
considerable changes during 400 years subjection to the Romans.

<p>
Of this kind of stile, the reader may see a specimen in the
following passage, taken from Young's spirit of Athens.
Page 6.
</p>
<p>
"Surely, in every mind, there is an emulation of virtuous
superiority, which, however fortune or the meaner passions
may hebitate its powers, still, at every example of success
in the particular object of its predilection, glows into a momentary
flame, which from frequent resuscitation may acquire
a stability and strength sufficient to reach at the attainment
of what, at first, was regarded solely as matter of
admiration; the idea of imitation which hath thus enraptured
the fancy, may in times of perilous crisis somewhat elevate
the mind and influence the conduct; and if such ever
may be the effect, what other lecture can ballance the utility
of that, which thus animates the man, and urges him to
noble and disinterested services in a good, great and public
cause."
</p>
<p>
The author could hardly have invented an arrangement,
better calculated to obscure his meaning.
</p>
<p>
It is said of Moliere, that before he would suffer a new
play of his to be acted, he read it to an old woman, and
judged, by the effect it had upon her, what reception it
would meet with on the stage. It is a pity, some modern
writers do not copy the example.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> I cannot think the French <i>devenir</i> prefixed to a verb
answers exactly to both these English forms. The deficiency
of the French in this respect, may be observed in
the following passage:
</p>
<p>
"S'il est vrai que vous <i>aimiez</i> la justice, &amp; que vous <i>alliez</i>
en Cr&eacute;te pour apprendre les loix du bon roi Minos, n'endurcissez
point votre c&oelig;ur contre mes soupirs &amp; contre
mes larmes."&mdash;&mdash;Telemaque, Liv. 4.
</p>
<p>
If we translate the passage thus: "If it is true that you
<i>love</i> justice and <i>go</i> to Crete," &amp;c. we lose the force of the
verb <i>alliez</i>; for the sense is evidently, <i>are going</i>, <i>are now on
your journey</i>. "If it is true that you <i>love</i> justice and <i>are
going</i> to Crete," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
In French the verbs <i>aimiez</i> and <i>alliez</i> are both in the same
tense, and have the same form of construction; in English
the verbs should be in the same tense, but have different forms
of construction. In French the force of <i>alliez</i> is collected
from the sense of the passage; but in English, it is expressed
by a particular construction.</p></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/image081c.png" alt="" />

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">From</span> a general history of
the English language, and
some remarks upon that
subject, I proceed to examin
its elements, or the powers
of the letters which
compose our alphabet.</p>

<p>There are in English, twenty five characters
or letters which are the representatives
of certain sounds, either simple or
combined; a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, j, k, l, m,
n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The
English have also the character <i>h</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
marks an aspiration or strong breathing,
but has very little sound of its own.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Letters, according to the sounds they
represent, or the purposes they serve, are
very naturally divided into three kinds;
<i>vowels</i>, <i>dipthongs</i>, and <i>consonants</i>.</p>

<p>In order to obtain clear ideas of our
alphabet, let us attend to the following
definitions:</p>

<p>1. A vocal sound, formed by opening
the mouth, and by a single position of the
organs of speech, is a simple sound or vowel.
Most of the vowels in English are capable
of being prolonged at pleasure, without
varying the position of the organs.</p>

<p>2. No more than one simple sound can
be formed by one aperture of the mouth,
and one position of the organs of speech.
The only difference that can be made with
the same position of the organs, is, to prolong
and shorten the same sound.</p>

<p>3. Two simple sounds, closely united in
pronunciation, or following each other so
rapidly that the distinction is scarcely perceptible,
form a dipthong. In pronoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>cing
a dipthong, two positions of the
parts of the mouth are required.</p>

<p>4. Those letters which are not marks
of articulate sounds, but represent indistinct
sounds, formed by some contact of the
parts of the mouth, or by compressing those
parts, check all sound, are denominated
consonants.</p>

<p>By the first definition we ascertain the
number of vowels in English. In pronouncing
each of the letters a<sup>1</sup>, a<sup>4</sup>, a<sup>3</sup>, e<sup>1</sup>, o<sup>1</sup>, o<sup>6</sup>, u<sup>2</sup>,
we observe but one position or aperture of
the mouth; the sounds are therefore simple,
and the letters are called <i>vowels</i>. The
six first sounds are capable of being prolonged
at pleasure.</p>

<p>By the second definition, we determine
which sounds are the same in quality, and
different only in the time of being pronounced.
Thus <i>i</i> in <i>fit</i> has the same quality
of sound as <i>ee</i> in <i>feet</i>, for both are pronounced
with the same disposition of the
organs; but the first is the shortest articulation
of the sound, and the last, a long or
grave articulation. The other vowels have
also their short or abrupt sounds; <i>a</i> in <i>late</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
has its short sound in <i>let</i>; <i>a</i> in <i>cart</i> has
its short sound in <i>carry</i>; <i>a</i> in <i>fall</i> has its
short sound in <i>folly</i>; <i>oo</i> in <i>fool</i> its short
sound in <i>full</i>. <i>O</i> is sometimes shortened
in common parlance, as in <i>colt</i>; but the
distinction between <i>o</i> in <i>coal</i> and <i>colt</i>, seems
to be accidental or caused by the final consonant,
and not sufficiently settled or important
to require a separate consideration.</p>

<p>By the third definition we are enabled
to ascertain the dipthongs in our language.
The letters <i>i</i>, <i>u</i> and <i>y</i> are usually
classed among the vowels; but the first or
long sound of each requires, in pronunciation,
two positions of the organs of speech,
or rather a transition from the position
necessary to form one simple sound, to the
position necessary to form another simple
sound. We begin the sound of <i>i</i> nearly
with the same aperture of the glottis, as
we do the broad <i>a</i> or <i>aw</i>: The aperture
however is not quite so great: We rapidly
close the mouth to the position where we
pronounce <i>ee</i>, and there stop the sound.
This letter is therefore a dipthong. <i>Y</i>
has no property but what belongs to <i>i</i>.</p>

<p><i>U</i> also is not strictly a vowel; nor is
it, as it is commonly represented, composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of <i>e</i> and <i>oo</i>. We do not begin the sound
in the position necessary to sound <i>ee</i>, as is
obvious in the words <i>salute</i>, <i>salubrious</i>, <i>revolution</i>;
but with a greater aperture of the
mouth and with a position perfectly easy
and natural. From that position we pass
to the position with which we pronounce
<i>oo</i>, and there close the sound.</p>

<p>It must however be observed that when
these letters, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, are followed by a consonant,
the two sounds of the dipthong are
not clearly distinguishable. We do not,
in <i>fight</i>, hear the sound of <i>ee</i>; nor the sound
of <i>oo</i> in <i>cube</i>. The consonant compresses
the organs and closes the sound of the
word so suddenly, that the ear can distinguish
but a simple vocal sound: And notwithstanding
these letters are dipthongs,
when considered by themselves, yet in combination
with consonants, they are often
marks of simple sounds or vowels.</p>

<p>The short sound of <i>i</i> and <i>y</i>, is merely
short <i>ee</i>. The sound of <i>u</i> in <i>tun</i>, is a separate
vowel, which has no affinity to any
other sound in the language.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>The sound of <i>oi</i> or <i>oy</i> is dipthongal,
composed of the third or broad <i>a</i>, and <i>ee</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The sound of <i>ou</i> or <i>ow</i> is also dipthongal,
compounded of third <i>a</i> and <i>oo</i>. The sound
however does not require quite so great an
aperture of the mouth as broad <i>a</i>; the position
is more natural, and the articulation
requires less exertion.</p>

<p>The union of <i>a</i> and <i>w</i> in <i>law</i>, has been
very erroneously considered a dipthong.
Whatever might have been the ancient
pronunciation of these letters (and it is
probable that good reasons operated to
produce their union) they now exhibit but
one simple vocal sound. The same may
be observed of <i>ee</i>, <i>oo</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>ai</i>, <i>ea</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ie</i>, <i>eo</i>, <i>oa</i>,
and perhaps some other combinations, each
of which actually exhibits the sound of one
letter only, which sound is as simple as that
of <i>a</i> or <i>o</i>.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Under the head of dipthongs we may
perhaps range <i>wa</i>, <i>we</i>, <i>wo</i>, <i>wi</i>, &amp;c. <i>W</i> has
nearly the short sound of <i>oo</i>; for <i>will</i>, <i>dwell</i>
are pronounced as if written <i>ooill</i>, <i>dooell</i>.
It is a controverted point, whether <i>w</i> should
be classed with the vowels or consonants.
I shall only observe, that it is pronounced
by opening the mouth, without a contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>of the parts; altho, in a rapid pronunciation,
it approaches to a consonant.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> It
is however very immaterial, whether we
class it with the vowels or consonants;
as all grammarians agree that its sound is
that of <i>oo</i> short. It ought to be named <i>oo</i>
or <i>we</i>; which would save children much of
the trouble they now experience, in learning
its proper sound from that awkward
name <i>double u</i>.</p>

<p>The sound of <i>y</i> in the beginning of
words, is, by some writers, called a vowel,
but by most of them a consonant. Lowth
has asserted, that it has every property of a
vowel and not one of a consonant. Sheridan
considers <i>y</i> in <i>youth</i>, <i>year</i>, &amp;c. as the
short <i>ee</i>. But if these writers would attend
to the manner in which we pronounce
<i>yes</i>, <i>ye</i>, they would acknowlege that <i>y</i> has
some property different from <i>ee</i>; for it is
very evident that they are not pronounced
<i>ee-es</i>, <i>ee-e</i>. The fact is, that in the American
pronunciation of <i>y</i>, the root of the tongue
is pressed against the upper part of the
mouth, above the palate, more closely than
it is in pronouncing <i>ee</i>, and not so closely
as in pronouncing <i>g</i> hard. The transition
however from <i>y</i> to <i>ee</i> or to <i>g</i>, is extremely
easy, and hence the mistake that <i>y</i> is short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<i>ee</i>, as also the convertibility of <i>y</i> with <i>g</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
It appears to me that <i>y</i> in the beginning
of words, is more clearly a consonant than <i>w</i>.</p>

<p>In many words, <i>i</i> has the power of <i>y</i>
consonant; particularly after <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>; as
<i>filial</i>, <i>union</i>.</p>

<p>The vowels therefore in English are
all heard in the following words; late,
half, hall, feet, pool, note, tun, fight, truth.
The five first have short sounds or duplicates;
which may be heard in let, hat, hot,
fit, pull; and the letters <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> are but
accidentally vowels. The pure primitive
vowels in English are therefore seven.</p>

<p>The dipthongs may be heard in the
following words; lie or defy, due, voice or
joy, round or now. To these we may add
<i>ua</i> in <i>persuade</i>; and perhaps the combinations
of w and the vowels, in <i>well</i>, <i>will</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The consonants in English are nineteen;
but for want of proper characters,
five of them are expressed or marked by
double letters. We annex two sounds to
<i>th</i>; one to <i>sh</i>; one to <i>ng</i>; and one to <i>si</i> or
<i>su</i>, as may be heard in the following words;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
think, this, shall, bring, confusion or
pleasure. These characters should be called
<i>eth</i>, <i>esh</i>, <i>eng</i>, <i>ezh</i>; and <i>th</i> should
have two names, the aspirate as in <i>think</i>,
and the vocal as in <i>this</i>; the latter sound
might be distinguished by a small mark
drawn thro <i>th</i>. This improvement is so
obvious and easy, and would be so convenient
for the learners of the language,
that I must believe it will soon be introduced.</p>

<p>The consonants may be divided into
<i>mutes</i> and <i>semivowels</i>. When a consonant
compresses the lips, or the tongue and roof
of the mouth, so closely as to check all sound,
it is called a <i>perfect mute</i>: Such are <i>p</i>, <i>k</i>,
and <i>t</i>, as may be perceived by pronouncing
the syllables, <i>ep</i>, <i>ek</i>, <i>et</i>. When the compression
of the organs is more gentle and
does not stop all sound immediately, the
letters are called mutes; such are <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, and
<i>g</i>, as may be perceived by pronouncing the
syllables, <i>eb</i>, <i>ed</i>, <i>eg</i>. When a consonant
has an imperfect sound, or hissing, which
may be continued, after a contact of the
organs, it is denominated a semivowel.
Of this kind are ef, el, em, en, er, es, ev,
ez, eth,[39] eth,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> esh, ezh, ing. Of these, four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>are aspirates, ef, es, eth, and esh. The others
are vocal, having an imperfect sound.</p>

<p>The whole may be thus arranged.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Perfect mutes&mdash;p, k, t.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Mutes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;b, d, g.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">vocal,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } l, m, n, r, v, z, th,</span><br />
Semivowels&mdash;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}    zh, ng,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">aspirate,} f, s, th, sh.</span><br />
</p>

<p>They may also be classed according to
the manner in which they are formed by
the organs: Thus, those formed</p>

<p>
By the lips, are called labials&mdash;b, p, f, v.<br />
By the teeth, are called dentals&mdash;d, t, th, z, s, sh, zh.<br />
By the palate, are called palatine&mdash;g, k, l, r.<br />
By the nose, are called nasal&mdash;m, n, ng.<br />
</p>

<p>On the subject of the alphabet, I have
this remark further; that for want of a
proper knowlege of the powers of <i>sh</i> and
<i>th</i>, some material errors in printing have
obtained in common practice. <i>Sh</i> are usually
united in printing, and generally
with propriety, for the combination represents
a simple consonant. But in several
compound words <i>s</i> and <i>h</i> have been improperly
united, where one is silent or
where each retains its own power, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
dishonor, dishonest, dishabille, hogshead,
household, falsehood, and some
others. The union of <i>sh</i> in these words,
is embarrassing, especially to children, who
are led to pronounce them <i>dish-onor</i>, <i>dish-onest</i>.
This error still prevails in printing,
except in the last mentioned word, which
is sometimes correctly printed <i>falsehood</i>.</p>

<p><i>Th</i>, tho not united in character, have a
tendency to produce, in some words, a
wrong pronunciation. For instance, we
are very apt to say <i>Wren-tham</i> instead of
<i>Wrent-ham</i>. <i>Hotham</i> is also ambiguous;
there is nothing in the orthography to direct
us, whether to pronounce it <i>Hot-ham</i>
or <i>Ho-tham</i>, altho custom decides in favor
of the latter.</p>

<p>These remarks show the propriety of
attending to our orthography, and of attempting
to remove causes of error, when
it can be done without much trouble or
danger of giving offence.</p>


<h3>RULES <i>of</i> PRONUNCIATION.</h3>

<p>Having briefly explained the English
alphabet, I proceed to the rules of pronunciation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>In pronunciation, two things demand
our notice; the proper sounds of the vowels
and consonants, and the accent.</p>

<p>In pronouncing both vowels and consonants,
the general rule is, <i>that similar combinations
of letters should be pronounced alike,
except when general custom has decided otherwise</i>.
Thus if <i>i</i> in the words, <i>bind</i>, <i>find</i>,
<i>mind</i>, has its first sound, it ought to have
the same sound in other similar combinations,
<i>kind</i>, <i>blind</i>, <i>grind</i>. This is the rule
of <i>analogy</i>, the great leading principle that
should regulate the construction of all languages.
But as languages are not formed
at once by system, and are ever exposed to
changes, it must necessarily happen that
there will be in all languages, some exceptions
from any general rule; some departures
from the principle of uniformity.</p>

<p>The practice of a nation, when universal
or ancient, has, in most cases, the force
and authority of law; it implies mutual and
general consent, and becomes a rule of
propriety. On this ground, some deviations
from the analogy of construction and
pronunciation must be admitted in all
languages. Thus from the analogy already
mentioned, <i>wind</i> is an exception; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
general practice has determined that <i>i</i>
should, in this word, have its second or
short sound.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Whether this deviation was
admitted at first to distinguish this word
from the verb <i>to wind</i>, or whether there
were other good reasons which cannot now
be explored, or whether it was merely the
work of ignorance or accident, it is unnecessary
to enquire; the common consent
of a nation is sufficient to stamp it
with propriety.</p>

<p>Another rule in English, which admits
of no exception, is, when the accent falls
on a vowel, it is long, as <i>o</i> in ho&acute;-ly; but
when the accent falls on a consonant, the
preceding vowel is short, as in <i>flat&acute;-ter</i>.</p>

<p>It is also a general rule, that when a
consonant closes a syllable, the preceding
vowel is short, as in <i>fan-cy</i>, <i>habit</i>; altho
this rule has its exceptions, as <i>Cam-bridge</i>,
<i>dan-ger</i>, and perhaps <i>man-ger</i>.</p>

<p>From this rule, the English except also
<i>a<sup>2</sup>ngel</i>, <i>a<sup>2</sup>ncient</i>. In this all the standard authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>agree, except Kenrick and Burn,
who mark <i>a</i> in <i>ancient</i> both long and short.
The English pronunciation is followed in
the middle and southern states; but the
eastern universities have restored these words
to the analogy of the language, and give
<i>a</i> its second sound. It is presumed that no
reason can be given for making these words
exceptions to the general rule, but practice;
and this is far from being universal,
there being many of the best speakers in
America, who give <i>a</i>, in the words mentioned,
the same sound as in <i>anguish</i>, <i>annals</i>,
<i>angelic</i>, <i>antiquity</i>.</p>

<p>The practice of the eastern universities
therefore should be encouraged, rather than
discountenanced; as it diminishes the number
of anomalies. I shall only remark further,
that <i>a</i> in these words must formerly
have had its third or fourth sound; which
is evident from the old orthography; for
angel, at least, was spelt like <i>grant</i>, <i>command</i>,
&amp;c. <i>aungel</i>, <i>graunt</i>, <i>commaund</i>. In
giving <i>a</i> its first sound therefore, the modern
English have not only infringed the
rule of analogy, but have deviated from
former practice.</p>

<p>In the word <i>chamber</i>, <i>a</i> has its fourth
sound. It is necessary to remark this; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
there are many people in America, who
give <i>a</i> its first sound, which is contrary to
analogy and to all the English authorities.</p>

<p>With regard to accent, that particular
stress of voice which should distinguish some
syllable of a word from others, three things
are to be considered; the importance of
the syllable; the derivation of the word;
and the terminating syllable.</p>

<p>The importance of a syllable is discovered
by resolving a word into the parts
which compose it, or reducing it to its
radicals. Thus <i>sensible</i> is derived from
<i>sensus</i> in Latin or <i>sense</i> in English. The
first syllable therefore is that on which the
meaning of the word principally depends;
the others being an accessary termination.</p>

<p>The first syllable then is the most important
and requires the accent. For the
same reason, <i>admire</i>, <i>compare</i>, <i>destroy</i>, &amp;c.
have the accent on the second syllable in
preference to the first; the last syllables
being all derived from verbs, and the first
being mere particles.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>Another rule for laying the accent of
words arises from derivation. Thus all
words that take the terminations <i>ing</i>, <i>ful</i>,
<i>less</i>, <i>ness</i>, <i>ed</i>, <i>est</i>, <i>ist</i>, <i>ly</i>, retain the accent on
the syllable where it is laid in their primitives;
as <i>proceed</i>, <i>proceeding</i>, <i>wonder</i>, <i>wonderful</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>But the most important article to be
considered in the accentuation of words, is
the terminating syllable. From the different
terminations of words arise various analogies,
the most of which are enumerated
in the first part of my Institute. The
principle which has operated to produce
these analogies, is the ease of speaking or
the harmony of enunciation. Consequently
this principle must take place of all others;
and we find that it frequently interferes
with the two foregoing rules, and regulates
practice in opposition to both.</p>

<p>The general rule, grounded on this
principle, is, that words, having the <i>same</i>
terminating syllable, have the accent at the
<i>same</i> distance from that termination. Thus
all words ending in <i>tion</i>, <i>sion</i>, <i>cion</i>, <i>cial</i>,
<i>cian</i>, have the accent on the last syllable
but one;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and this without any regard to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>derivation or to the number of syllables in
the word.</p>

<p>Thus most words in <i>ty</i>, if they consist
of more syllables than two, have the accent
on the antepenult; as <i>probity</i>, <i>absurdity</i>,
<i>probability</i>. I recollect but two exceptions,
viz. <i>commonalty</i>, <i>admiralty</i>; the accent
of which is laid upon the first syllable, as
in their primitives.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>But let us observe the force of the last
rule, in opposition to the others. <i>Mortal</i>
has the accent on the first syllable. Here
the first rule takes place, for the first syllable,
having <i>mors</i>, death, for its root, is the
most important. But the derivative, <i>mortality</i>,
conforms to the analogy of words
ending in <i>ty</i> and has the accent on the last
syllable but two. That the ease or harmony
of pronunciation, is the cause of this
change of accent, will be evident to any
person who shall attempt to pronounce
words of this class, with the accent on any
other syllable than the antepenult.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>Most of these rules admit a few exceptions,
which are to be learnt by practice.
Custom has made some inroads upon the
rules of uniformity, and caprice is ever
busy in multiplying anomalies. Still, rules
will be of great service in ascertaining and
fixing our language; for tho they may not
root out <i>old</i> errors, they may prevent the
introduction of <i>others</i>.</p>

<p>But besides the principal accent, there
is, in most polysyllables, an inferior accent
laid on the third or fourth syllable from
the principal. Indeed in some words, the
two accents are so nearly equal, as to be
scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>It is denied by some critics that there
are more accents than one, in any word.
But the composition of words, and the ease
of speaking, both require a plurality of
accent in a very great number of instances;
and our ears inform us that such a plurality
actually exists in practice. If a man
will assert that in such words as <i>designation</i>,
<i>exaltation</i>, there is but one syllable distinguished
from the others by a superior stress
of voice, he must deny the evidence of
sense, and would not listen to argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>I must however remark that most, if
not all syllables, derived from some important
word, have some degree of accent:<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
So that in compounds, there are usually as
many accents as radicals. Thus in <i>sanctify</i>,
which is composed of two radicals,
<i>sanctus</i> and <i>fio</i>, we observe two accents;
the strongest on the first syllable. The
same may be observed in <i>magnanimity</i>, from
<i>magnus</i> and <i>animus</i>, in <i>promogeniture</i>, &amp;c.
except that in these the principal accent is
on the third syllable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding it is a general rule,
that there are as many accents in a word,
as radicals, yet one of them at least is frequently
removed from the principal syllable,
by the analogy of termination, which
prevails over all other reasons. Thus in
<i>mathematics</i>, the two accents lie on the
proper syllables; but in <i>mathematician</i>, the
last accent is removed to a less important
place. In <i>imperceptible</i>, the principal accent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>with propriety, lies on the third syllable,
which being derived from a verb (<i>capio</i>)
is the most important. The particle
<i>im</i>, being the privative, or that syllable
which changes the meaning of the whole
word from affirmative to negative, becomes
important and has some degree of accent.
But in the derivative <i>imperceptibility</i>, while
the first and third syllables retain an accent,
the analogy of termination carries the principal
accent to the fifth syllable, which is
adventitious and less important than the
others.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In many compounds, as, <i>earth-quake</i>,
<i>rain-bow</i>, each syllable is pronounced with
the stress that belongs to accented syllables;
and there is little or no distinction of accent.
The reason is obvious: There is
no difference in the importance of the syllables;
both are equally necessary to convey
the idea. By giving one syllable the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>whole accent, such a word loses its original
meaning, or at least its force, as may be
observed in the word <i>hussy</i>, a corruption of
<i>house-wife</i>; which, from an affectation of a
unity of accent, and a hasty pronunciation,
has sunk into a low word. From the same
ridiculous affectation, <i>work-house</i> is, by some
people, pronounced <i>work-us</i>.</p>

<p>On this head, I shall only observe further,
that some words of many syllables
have three accents; of which we have an
example in <i>val'etu'dina'rian</i>.</p>

<p>It has been already remarked that the
composition of words, and the ease of
speaking, require a plurality of accent.
The reason why words of many syllables
have two or three accents, is plain to any
man that attempts to pronounce them
without an accent.</p>

<p>We cannot pronounce more than two
unaccented syllables with perfect ease; but
four or five can hardly be articulated without
an intervening accent. We glide over
the unaccented syllables with such rapidity,
that we have hardly time to place the
organs in a position to articulate them.
The difficulty is in proportion to the num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ber:
So that after passing over two or
three, the voice very naturally rests or falls
forceably upon a particular syllable. Hence
the words most difficult to be pronounced,
are those of four syllables, accented on the
first; as <i>figurative</i>, <i>literature</i>, <i>applicable</i>.
The difficulty is very great, when the
middle syllables abound with consonants,
even in trissyllables, as <i>ag'grandize</i>; but is
itself a sufficient reason for not accenting
the first syllable of such words as <i>acceptable</i>
and <i>refractory</i>. When one of the
words which have the accent on the first,
and three succeeding unaccented syllables,
is followed by two or three particles, the
passage is weak and often occasions hesitation
in a speaker; as "<i>applicable to the affairs
of common life</i>."</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of this, we
find in Priestley's Preface to Letters to a
Philosophical Unbeliever; "Whether of a
<i>pleasureable or of a</i> painful nature." In
this example there are six weak syllables
following each other without interruption,
and such passages are not reduceable to any
kind of poetic feet. This assemblage of
unimportant syllables makes a hiatus in
language, which should, as far as possible,
be avoided by a writer; for the melody of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
prose consists in a proper mixture of important
and unimportant syllables.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>


<h3>DIFFERENCES <i>of</i> PRONUNCIATION
<i>and</i> CONTROVERTED POINTS EXAMINED.</h3>

<p>Having laid down some general rules
reflecting pronunciation, I proceed to examin
local differences, and the most material
points of controversy on this subject.</p>

<p>In the eastern states, there is a practice
prevailing among the body of the people,
of prolonging the sound of <i>i</i> in the termination
<i>ive</i>. In such words as <i>motive</i>, <i>relative</i>,
&amp;c. the people, excepting the more
polished part, give <i>i</i> its first sound. This
is a local practice, opposed to the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>pronunciation of the English on both sides
of the Atlantic, sometimes to the rules of accent,
and always to derivation. In dissyllables,
as <i>motive</i>, <i>active</i>, the genius of our
language requires that the accent should
be laid on <i>one</i> syllable, and that the other
should be short.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But by prolonging <i>i</i> in
the last, the distinction of accent is totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>In polysyllables, which often have two
accents, this reason has less force, but the
derivation, which is from the French <i>motif</i>,
<i>relatif</i>, always requires that <i>i</i> in the
termination <i>ive</i> should have the sound of
<i>ee</i> short, as in <i>live</i>, <i>give</i>. This is merely
the short sound of the French <i>i</i>, and the
consequence of the English accent on the
first syllable. These reasons, with the authority
of the most approved practice,
should operate to discountenance the singular
drawling pronunciation of the eastern
people.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The same reasons are opposed to another
local practice of a similar nature in the
middle states; where many people pronounce
<i>practise</i>, <i>prejudice</i>, with <i>i</i> long. I
know of no authority for this beyond the
limits of two or three states; and it is clear
that the practice is not warranted by any
principle in the language.</p>

<p>Another very common error, among
the yeomanry of America, and particularly
in New England, is the pronouncing of <i>e</i>
before <i>r</i>, like <i>a</i>; as <i>marcy</i> for mercy. This
mistake must have originated principally in
the name of the letter <i>r</i>, which, in most of
our school books, is called <i>ar</i>. This single
mistake has spread a false pronunciation of
several hundred words, among millions of
people.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>To avoid this disagreeable singularity
some fine speakers have run into another
extreme, by pronouncing <i>e</i> before <i>r</i>, like <i>u</i>,
<i>murcy</i>. This is an error. The true sound
of the short <i>e</i>, as in <i>let</i>, is the correct and
elegant pronunciation of this letter in all
words of this class.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a vulgar singularity in the
pronunciation of the eastern people, which
is very incorrect, and disagreeable to strangers;
that of prefixing the sound of <i>i</i> short or
<i>e</i>, before the dipthong <i>ow</i>; as <i>kiow</i>, <i>piower</i>
or <i>peower</i>. This fault usually occurs after
<i>p</i>, <i>c</i> hard, or those other consonants which
are formed near the seat of <i>ee</i> in the mouth,
or in passing from which to the succeeding
vowel, the organs naturally take the position
necessary to pronounce <i>ee</i>. But the
most awkward countryman pronounces
<i>round</i>, <i>ground</i>, &amp;c. with tolerable propriety.</p>

<p>This, with some other peculiarities which
prevail among the yeomanry of New England,
springs from causes that do not exist,
in the same degree, in any other part of America,
perhaps not in the world. It may
surprize those who have not turned their
thoughts to this subject, that I should ascribe
the manner of speaking among a people,
to the nature of their government and
a distribution of their property. Yet it is
an undoubted fact that the drawling nasal
manner of speaking in New England arises
almost solely from these causes.</p>

<p>People of large fortunes, who pride
themselves on family distinctions, possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
certain boldness, dignity and independence
in their manners, which give a correspondent
air to their mode of speaking. Those
who are accustomed to command slaves, form
a habit of expressing themselves with the
tone of authority and decision.</p>

<p>In New England, where there are few
slaves and servants, and less family distinctions
than in any other part of America,
the people are accustomed to address each
other with that diffidence, or attention to
the opinion of others, which marks a state
of equality. Instead of commanding, they
advise; instead of saying, with an air of decision,
<i>you must</i>; they ask with an air of
doubtfulness, <i>is it not best?</i> or give their
opinions with an indecisive tone; <i>you had
better, I believe</i>. Not possessing that pride
and consciousness of superiority which attend
birth and fortune, their intercourse
with each other is all conducted on the idea
of equality, which gives a singular tone
to their language and complexion to their
manners.</p>

<p>These remarks do not apply to the commercial
towns; for people who are conversant
with a variety of company lose most
of their singularities, and hence well bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
people resemble each other in all countries.
But the peculiar traits of national character
are found in the internal parts of a
country, among that class of people who
do not travel, nor are tempted by an intercourse
with foreigners, to quit their own
habits.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Such are the causes of the local peculiarities
in pronunciation, which prevail among
the country people in New England,
and which, to foreigners, are the objects
of ridicule. The great error in their manner
of speaking proceeds immediately from
not opening the mouth sufficiently. Hence
words are drawled out in a careless lazy
manner, or the sound finds a passage thro
the nose.</p>

<p>Nothing can be so disagreeable as that
drawling, whining cant that distinguishes
a certain class of people; and too much
pains cannot be taken to reform the practice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>Great efforts should be made by
teachers of schools, to make their pupils open
the teeth, and give a full clear sound
to every syllable. The beauty of speaking
consists in giving each letter and syllable
its due proportion of sound, with a prompt
articulation.</p>

<p>Thus in order to pronounce <i>cow</i>, <i>power</i>,
or <i>gown</i> with propriety, the pupil should
be taught, after placing the organs in the
position required by the first consonant, to
open his mouth wide, before he begins the
sound of <i>ow</i>: Otherwise in passing from
that position to the aperture necessary to
pronounce <i>ow</i>, he will inevitably articulate
<i>ee</i>, <i>keow</i>.</p>

<p>A similar method is recommended to
those polite speakers who are so fond of
imitating the English stage pronunciation
as to embrace every singularity, however
disagreeable. I refer to the very modern
pronunciation of <i>kind</i>, <i>sky</i>, <i>guide</i>, &amp;c. in
which we hear the short <i>e</i> before <i>i</i>, <i>keind</i>, or
<i>kyind</i>, <i>skey</i>, &amp;c. This is the same barbarous
dialect, as the <i>keow</i> and <i>veow</i> of the
eastern country people. Yet, strange as it
may seem, it is the elegant pronunciation
of the fashionable people both in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and America. Even Sheridan, who has
laid it down as a rule that <i>i</i> is a dipthong,
composed of <i>aw</i> and <i>ee</i>, has prefixed a <i>y</i>
short to its sound in several words; as
<i>kyind</i>, <i>skyi</i>, <i>gyide</i>, &amp;c. We may with equal
propriety prefix <i>e</i> to the dipthong <i>ow</i>, or to
<i>o</i> in <i>poll</i>, or to <i>oo</i> in <i>fool</i>, or to any other
vowel. It is presumed that the bare mention
of such barbarisms will be sufficient
to restrain their progress, both in New England
and on the British theater.</p>

<p>Some of the southern people, particularly
in Virginia, almost omit the sound
of <i>r</i> as in <i>ware</i>, <i>there</i>. In the best English
pronunciation, the sound of <i>r</i> is much
softer than in some of the neighboring
languages, particularly the Irish and Spanish;
and probably much softer than in the
ancient Greek. But there seems to be no
good reason for omitting the sound altogether;
nor can the omission be defended
on the ground, either of good practice or
of rules. It seems to be a habit contracted
by carelessness.</p>

<p>It is a custom very prevalent in the
middle states, even among some well bred
people, to pronounce <i>off</i>, <i>soft</i>, <i>drop</i>, <i>crop</i>,
with the sound of <i>a</i>, <i>aff</i>, <i>saft</i>, <i>drap</i>, <i>crap</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
This seems to be a foreign and local dialect;
and cannot be advocated by any
person who understands correct English.
<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[L]</a></p>

<p>In the middle states also, many people
pronounce a <i>t</i> at the end of <i>once</i> and <i>twice</i>,
<i>oncet</i> and <i>twicet</i>. This gross impropriety
would not be mentioned, but for its prevalence
among a class of very well educated
people; particularly in Philadelphia and
Baltimore.</p>

<p><i>Fotch</i> for <i>fetch</i> is very common, in several
states, but not among the better classes
of people. <i>Cotched</i> for <i>caught</i> is more
frequent, and equally barbarous.</p>

<p><i>Skroud</i> and <i>skrouge</i> for <i>croud</i>, are sometimes
heard among people that should be
ashamed of the least vulgarism.</p>

<p><i>Mought</i> for <i>might</i> is heard in most of
the states, but not frequently except in a
few towns.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>

<p><i>Holpe</i> for <i>help</i> I have rarely heard except
in Virginia. <i>Tote</i> is local in Virginia
and its neighborhood. In meaning it
is nearly equivalent to <i>carry</i>. I have tak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>en
great pains to discover the etymology
of the local terms used in the several
states; but this word has yet eluded my
diligence.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><i>Chore</i>, a corruption of <i>char</i>, is an English
word, still used in many parts of
England, as a <i>char-man</i>, a <i>char-woman</i>,
but in America, it is perhaps confined to
New England. It signifies small domestic
jobs of work, and its place cannot be
supplied by any other single word in the
language.</p>

<p>These local words, and others of less
note, are gradually growing into disuse,
and will probably be lost: Except such
as are necessary in some particular occupation.</p>

<p>The pronunciation of <i>w</i> for <i>v</i> is a prevailing
practice in England and America:
It is particularly prevalent in Boston and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Many people say <i>weal</i>, <i>wessel</i>,
for <i>veal</i>, <i>vessel</i>.</p>

<p>These letters are easily mistaken for
each other, and the name of the letter <i>w</i>
now used, is a proof that the letter <i>v</i> was
formerly called <i>u</i> or <i>oo</i>. The letter in the
Roman language had the sound we now
give <i>w</i> in <i>will</i>. <i>Via</i> and <i>vinum</i>, pronounced
<i>wia</i>, <i>winum</i>, have suffered but a small
change of pronunciation in our <i>way</i>, <i>wine</i>.
In old English books, down to Shakespear,
<i>v</i> was written for the short <i>u</i>, as <i>vp</i>, <i>vnder</i>;
for <i>up</i>, <i>under</i>. On the other hand, <i>u</i>
was written where we now write <i>v</i>, as <i>uery</i>,
<i>euery</i>, for <i>very</i>, <i>every</i>. It seems therefore,
that <i>v</i> had formerly the sound of <i>w</i> or <i>oo</i>;
and that instead of corrupting the language,
the Cockneys in London, and their imitators
in America, who say <i>weal</i>, <i>wery</i>, have
retained the primitive pronunciation. In
confirmation of this opinion, it may be observed
that the Danes, who speak a dialect
of the Saxon, have no <i>w</i> in their language,
but where we write <i>w</i>, they write <i>v</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>where we write <i>wh</i>, they invariably write
<i>hv</i>; as <i>vind</i>, <i>wind</i>; <i>vej</i>, <i>way</i>; <i>vader</i>, <i>wade</i>;
<i>hvad</i>, <i>what</i>; <i>hvide</i>, <i>white</i>; <i>hvi</i>, <i>why</i>. The
Germans, whose language is another branch
of the same stock, invariably pronounce <i>w</i>
as we do <i>v</i>; <i>wall</i>, <i>vall</i>; <i>wir</i>, <i>vir</i>, <i>we</i>; <i>wollen</i>,
<i>vollen</i>, <i>will</i>; and <i>v</i> they pronounce as
we do <i>f</i>; as <i>vergessen</i>, <i>fergessen</i>, which is the
same as the English <i>forget</i>.</p>

<p>The retaining the old sound of <i>v</i> is a
proof of the force of custom; but since the
nation in general have annexed to it a precise
sound, as well as to <i>w</i>, every person
should resign his peculiarities for the sake
of uniformity.</p>

<p>But there are some points in pronunciation,
in which the best informed people
differ, both in opinion and practice.</p>

<p>The words <i>shall</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>quantity</i>, <i>qualify</i>,
<i>quandary</i>, <i>quadrant</i>, are differently pronounced
by good speakers. Some give <i>a</i> a broad
sound, as <i>shol</i>, <i>quolity</i>; and others, its second
sound, as in <i>hat</i>. With respect to the four
first, almost all the standard writers<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> agree
to pronounce <i>a</i> short, as in <i>hat</i>: And this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>the stage pronunciation. It is correct, for
it is more agreeable to the analogy of the
language; that being the proper sound of
the English <i>a</i> which is heard in <i>hat</i> or <i>bar</i>.
With respect to the two last, authors differ;
some give the first, some the second, and
others the fifth sound. They all pretend
to give us the court pronunciation, and as
they differ so widely, we must suppose that
eminent speakers differ in practice. In
such a case, we can hardly hesitate a moment
to call in analogy to decide the question,
and give <i>a</i> in all these words, as also
in <i>quash</i>, its second sound.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The words <i>either</i>, <i>neither</i>, <i>deceit</i>, <i>conceit</i>,
<i>receipt</i>, are generally pronounced, by the
eastern people, <i>ither</i>, <i>nither</i>, <i>desate</i>, <i>consate</i>,
<i>resate</i>. These are errors; all the standard
authors agree to give <i>ei</i>, in these words, the
sound of <i>ee</i>. This is the practice in England,
in the middle and southern states,
and, what is higher authority, analogy
warrants the practice. Indeed it is very
absurd to pronounce the verb <i>conceive</i>, <i>conceeve</i>,
and the noun <i>conceit</i>, <i>consate</i>. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>an inconsistency will hardly find advocates,
except among the prejudiced and uninformed.</p>

<p><i>Importance</i> is, by a few people, pronounced
impo<sup>1</sup>rtance; with the first sound
of <i>o</i>. The reason alleged is, that it is a
derivative of <i>import</i>, and <i>o</i> should preserve
the same sound it has in the original. It
seems however to be affectation, for the
standard writers and general practice are
opposed to it. Indeed it may be considered
as a mere imitation of the French pronunciation
of the same word.</p>

<p><i>Decis-ive</i> for <i>deci-sive</i> is mere affectation.</p>

<p><i>Reesin</i> for <i>raisin</i> is very prevalent in two
or three principal towns in America. One
of the standard authors gives us this pronunciation;
and another gives us both
<i>raisin</i> and <i>reesin</i>. But all the others pronounce
the word <i>raisin</i>, with <i>a</i> long; and
derivation, analogy and general custom,
all decide in favor of the practice.</p>

<p><i>Leisure</i> is sometimes pronounced <i>leesure</i>,
and sometimes <i>lezhure</i>: The latter is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
most general pronunciation in America.
It is almost singular in its spelling; <i>seizure</i>
being the only word in analogy with it;
and this is a derivative from <i>seize</i>. The
true original orthography of <i>leisure</i> was
<i>leasure</i>; this was in analogy with <i>pleasure</i>,
<i>measure</i>, and its ancient pronunciation still
remains.</p>

<p><i>Dictionary</i> has been usually pronounced
<i>dicsonary</i>; But its derivation from <i>diction</i>,
the analogous pronunciation of <i>tion</i>
in other cases, and all the standard writers
require <i>dicshunary</i>, or <i>dicshonary</i>.</p>

<p>One author of eminence pronounces <i>defile</i>
in three syllables, <i>def-i-le</i>. In this he
is singular; neither general practice, nor
rules warrant the pronunciation; and all
the other authorities are against him.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>oblige</i>, authorities differ.
The standard writers give us both
<i>oblige</i> and <i>obleege</i>, and it is impossible to determine
on which side the weight of authority
lies. The direct derivation of the
word from the French would incline us to
prefer <i>obleege</i>, in the analogy of <i>fatigue</i>, <i>machine</i>,
<i>antique</i>, <i>pique</i>, <i>marine</i>, <i>oblique</i>, which
uniformly preserve the French <i>i</i> or Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>lish
<i>ee</i>. Yet Chesterfield called this affectation,
and it might be so in his age; for
the opinions of men are capricious. The
English analogy requires <i>i</i> long in <i>oblige</i>;
and perhaps this should incline all parties
to meet each other on that best principle.</p>

<p>Some people very erroneously pronounce
<i>chaise</i>, <i>sha</i> in the singular, and <i>shaze</i> in the
plural. The singular number is <i>shaze</i>, and
the plural, <i>shazes</i>.</p>

<p>Our modern fashionable speakers accent
<i>European</i> on the last syllable but one.
This innovation has happened within a
few years: I say innovation; for it is a
violation of an established principle of the
language, that words ending in <i>ean</i> have
the accent on the last syllable but two:
Witness <i>Mediterra'nean</i>, <i>Pyre'nean</i>, <i>Hercu'lean</i>,
<i>subterra'nean</i>. I do not advert to an
exception,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and why <i>European</i> should be
made one, it is difficult to determine. The
reason given by some, that <i>e</i> in the penultima
represents the Latin dipthong <i>&aelig;</i>, which
was long, is of little weight, opposed to
the general practice of a nation, and to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>established principle. The standard authors,
in this instance, as in all others,
where practice is not uniform, very absurdly
give both pronunciations, that we
may take our choice. As this is a very
easy method of getting over difficulties, and
passing along without giving offence, so it
is a certain way to perpetuate differences
in opinion and practice, and to prevent the
establishment of any standard. Analogy
requires <i>Euro'pean</i>, and this is supported
by as good authorities as the other.</p>

<p><i>Rome</i> is very frequently pronounced
<i>Room</i>, and that by people of every class.
The authors I have consulted give no light
upon this word, except Perry, who directs
to that pronunciation. The practice however,
is by no means general in America:
There are many good speakers who give <i>o</i>
its first sound. It seems very absurd to
give <i>o</i> its first sound in <i>Romish</i>, <i>Romans</i>,
and pronounce it <i>oo</i> in <i>Rome</i>, the radical
word. I know of no language in Europe,
in which <i>o</i> has not one uniform sound, viz.
the sound we give it in <i>rose</i>. It is perhaps
the only vowel, in the sound of which all
nations agree. In English it has other
sounds; but the first is its proper one. A
great proportion of people in America have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
restored the analogy of pronunciation in
giving <i>o</i> its first found in <i>Rome</i>; and a desire
of uniformity would lead us to extend
the practice.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In the pronunciation of <i>arch</i> in many
compound words, people are not uniform.
The disputed words are <i>archangel</i>, <i>archetype</i>,
<i>architecture</i>, <i>architrave</i>, <i>archives</i>. There
seems to be no settled principle of analogy,
by which the question can be determined.
Etymology would require <i>ch</i>, in Greek and
Hebrew derivatives, to have uniformly the
sound of <i>k</i>; but before most consonants,
such a pronunciation is harsh; for which
reason it is generally softened into the
English <i>ch</i>, as <i>archbishop</i>. But before vowels,
as in the words just enumerated, the
best practice has decided for the sound of
<i>k</i>; and euphony, as well as derivation, favors
the decision.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>The sound of <i>ch</i> in <i>chart</i> is likewise disputed;
and the standard authors are directly
opposed to each other. There is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>good foreign authority on one side as the
other; but in America, <i>ch</i> has generally
its soft or English sound. This must perhaps
be preferred, contrary to etymology;
for we uniformly give <i>ch</i> that sound in
<i>charter</i>, which is from the same original;
and this also distinguishes the word from
<i>cart</i>; a reason which is not without its
weight.</p>

<p>There are many people who omit the
aspirate in most words which begin with
<i>wh</i>; as <i>white</i>, <i>whip</i>, &amp;c. which they pronounce
<i>wite</i>, <i>wip</i>. To such it is necessary
only to observe, that in the pure English
pronunciation, both in Great Britain and
New England, for it is exactly the same in
both, <i>h</i> is not silent in a single word beginning
with <i>wh</i>. In this point our standard
authors differ; two of them aspirating the
whole of these words, and three, marking
<i>h</i> in most of them as mute. But the omission
of <i>h</i> seems to be a foreign corruption;
for in America, it is not known among the
unmixed descendants of the English. Sheridan
has here given the true English pronunciation.
In this class of words, <i>w</i> is
silent in four only, with their derivatives;
viz. <i>who</i>, <i>whole</i>, <i>whoop</i>, <i>whore</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>One or two authors affect to pronounce
<i>human</i>, and about twenty other words beginning
with <i>h</i>, as tho they were spelt <i>yuman</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
This is a gross error. The only
word that begins with this sound, is <i>humor</i>,
with its derivatives. In the American pronunciation,
<i>h</i> is silent in the following,
<i>honest</i>, <i>honor</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>humor</i>, <i>herb</i>, <i>heir</i>, with
their derivatives. To these the English
add <i>hospital</i>, <i>hostler</i>, <i>humble</i>; but an imitation
of these, which some industriously affect,
cannot be recommended, as every omission
of the aspirate serves to mutilate
and weaken the language.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>The word <i>yelk</i> is sometimes written <i>yolk</i>
and pronounced <i>yoke</i>. But <i>yelk</i> is the most
correct orthography, from the Saxon <i>gealkwe</i>;
and in this country, it is the general
pronunciation.</p>

<p><i>Ewe</i> is, by the English, often pronounced
<i>yo</i>; which is sometimes heard in America.
But analogy and the general corresponding
practice in this country, with
the authority of some of the most accurate
writers, decide for <i>yew</i>.</p>

<p>The English speakers of eminence have
shortened the vowel in the first syllable of
<i>tyranny</i>, <i>zealous</i>, <i>sacrifice</i>, &amp;c. altho in the
primitive words, all agree to give the vowel
its first sound. This pronunciation has
not spread among the people of this country;
but our learned men have adopted
it; and it seems in some degree to be the
genius of our language. In <i>child</i>, <i>clean</i>,
<i>holy</i>, &amp;c. we uniformly give the first vowel
its long sound; but when a syllable is added,
we always shorten it; <i>children</i>, <i>clenly</i>,
<i>holyday</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many people in America
say <i>pat-ron</i>, <i>mat-ron</i>; whereas the
English say either <i>pa-tron</i> or <i>pat-ron</i>, <i>ma</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><i>tron</i>
or <i>mat-ron</i>; but all agree in saying,
<i>pat-ronage</i>. In <i>patriot</i>, <i>patriotism</i>, the English
give <i>a</i> its long sound; but a great part
of the Americans, its short sound. In all
these cases, where people are not uniform,
I should prefer the short sound; for it appears
to me the most analogous.</p>

<p><i>Wrath</i>, the English pronounce with the
third sound of <i>a</i> or <i>aw</i>; but the Americans
almost universally preserve the analogous
sound, as in <i>bath</i>, <i>path</i>. This is the correct
pronunciation; and why should we
reject it for <i>wroth</i>, which is a corruption?
If the English practice is erroneous, let it
remain so; we have no concern with it:
By adhering to our own practice, we preserve
a superiority over the English, in
those instances, in which ours is guided by
rules; and so far ought we to be from conforming
to their practice, that they ought
rather to conform to ours.</p>

<p>It is disputed whether <i>g</i> should have its
hard or soft sound, in <i>homogeneous</i> and <i>heterogeneous</i>:
On this question the standard authors
are not agreed. The hard sound, as
in <i>go</i>, coincides with etymology; but analogy
requires the other, as in <i>genius</i>. The
same remarks apply to <i>g</i> in <i>phlogiston</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle and southern states, <i>fierce</i>,
<i>pierce</i>, <i>tierce</i>, are pronounced <i>feerce</i>, <i>peerce</i>,
<i>teerce</i>. To convince the people of the impropriety
of this pronunciation, it might
be sufficient to inform them, that it is not
fashionable on the English theater. For
those who want better proofs, before they
relinquish their practice, I would observe,
that these words are derived to us from the
French; <i>fierce</i>, <i>tierce</i>, from <i>fiers</i>, <i>tiers</i>, and

the French pronounce both <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>; but
it is evident the English originally pronounced

into <i>pierce</i> till after Spenser wrote.</p>

</p>

<p>The rhime in the last quotation, is not
unequivocal proof of the pronunciation in
Pope's time; but the orthography in Chaucer's
and Spenser's writings, are to me satisfactory
evidence that <i>e</i> in these words was
short. The standard English pronunciation
now is <i>ferce</i>, <i>perce</i>, <i>terce</i>, and it is universal
in New England. I have only to
add, that the sharp abrupt sound of <i>e</i> in
the two first words is most happily adapted
to express the ideas.</p>

<p>The English pronounce <i>leap</i>, <i>lep</i>; and
that in the present tense as well as the past.
Some of our American horsemen have
learnt the practice; but among other people,
it is almost unknown. It is a breach
of analogy, at least in the present tense;
the American pronunciation, <i>leep</i>, is therefore
the most correct and should not be relinquished.</p>

<p>In the fashionable world, <i>heard</i> is pronounced
<i>herd</i> or <i>hurd</i>. This was almost
unknown in America till the commencement
of the late war, and how long it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
been the practice in England, I cannot determine.
By Chaucer's orthography, one
would imagine that it had been handed
down from remote antiquity; for he writes
<i>herd</i>, <i>herde</i>, and <i>herden</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In reading more
modern poets, I have rarely found any instance
of a verse's closing with this word;
so that it is difficult to say what has been
the general practice among the learned.
But for centuries, the word has been uniformly
spelt <i>heard</i>; the verb <i>hear</i> is in analogy
with <i>fear</i>, <i>sear</i>, and yet <i>e</i> in the past
time and participle has been omitted, as
<i>heard</i>, not <i>heared</i>. That <i>herd</i> was not formerly
the pronunciation, is probable from
this circumstance; the Americans were
strangers to it when they came from England,
and the body of the people are so to
this day.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> To most people in this country,
the English pronunciation appears like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>affectation, and is adopted only in the capital
towns, which are always the most ready
to distinguish themselves by an implicit
imitation of foreign customs. Analogy
requires that we should retain our former
practice; for we may as well change <i>feared</i>,
<i>seared</i>, into <i>ferd</i>, <i>serd</i>, as to change <i>heard</i>
into <i>herd</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beard</i> is sometimes, but erroneously,
pronounced <i>beerd</i>. General practice, both
in England and America, requires that <i>e</i>
should be pronounced as in <i>were</i>, and I
know of no rule opposed to the practice.</p>

<p><i>Deaf</i> is generally pronounced <i>deef</i>. It
is the universal practice in the eastern
states; and it is general in the middle and
southern; tho some have adopted the English
pronunciation, <i>def</i>. The latter is evidently
a corruption; for the word is in
analogy with <i>leaf</i> and <i>sheaf</i>, and has been
from time immemorial. So in Sir William
Temple's works, Virg. Ecl.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&mdash;&mdash;"We sing not to the deaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An answer comes from every trembling leaf."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Leaf</i> and <i>deaf</i>, with a different orthography,
are repeatedly made to rhime in
Chaucer's works; as in the Wife of Bath's
Prologue, L. 6217,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For that I rent out of his book a lefe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of the stroke myn ere wex al <i>defe</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So also line 6249.</p>

<p>This was the orthography of his time,
and an almost conclusive evidence that <i>deaf</i>
was pronounced <i>deef</i>.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This pronunciation
is generally retained in America, and
analogy requires it.</p>

<p>This dissertation will be closed with one
observation, which the reader may have
made upon the foregoing criticisms: That
in many instances the Americans still adhere
to the analogies of the language, where
the English have infringed them. So far
therefore as the regularity of construction
is concerned, we ought to retain our own
practice and be our own standards. The
English practice is an authority; but considering
the force of custom and the caprice
of fashion, their practice must be as liable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>to changes and to errors, as the practice
of a well educated yeomanry, who are governed
by habits and not easily led astray by
novelty. In the instances where we have
adhered to analogy, no consideration can
warrant us in resigning our practice to the
authority of a foreign court, which, thro
mere affectation, may have embraced many
obvious errors. In doubtful cases, to pay
a suitable deference to the opinions of others,
is wise and prudent; but to renounce
an obvious principle of propriety because
others have renounced it, is to carry our
complaisance for the faults of the great,
much farther than we can justify, and in a
<i>nation</i>, it is an act of servility that wants a
name.</p>

each, by which the opposition of sense is distinguished.
"Sins of o'mission and com'mission." Thus when we use
the word <i>regain</i>, we often lay an accent on <i>re</i> almost equal
to that on <i>gain</i>; because the sense of the word depends

there is none more erroneous.
</p>
<p>
I would just remark here that many writers use <i>an</i> before
<i>h</i> aspirate, instead of <i>a</i>; which practice seems not well
founded. The rapid sound of the article <i>a</i> is indistinct,
but opens the mouth to a proper position to pronounce <i>h</i>;
whereas <i>n</i> places the end of the tongue under the upper
teeth, and the mouth assumes a new position, before the aspiration
can be formed. <i>A</i> hundred, <i>a</i> house, &amp;c. are
therefore much more easily articulated, than <i>an</i> hundred,
<i>an</i> house.
</p>
<p>
Thus <i>a</i> should always be used before <i>y</i> consonant, and
consequently before <i>u</i> when it has the same sound, as in
<i>union</i>, <i>universal</i>, &amp;c. Indeed I cannot account for the use of
<i>an</i> before <i>y</i>, on any other principle than this, that the persons
who use it do not pronounce <i>y</i> at all. If they make <i>y</i> the
same as <i>ee</i>, it is consistent to write <i>an</i> before it; but this is an
error.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding dissertation
I have endeavored to settle
a number of controverted
points and local differences
in pronunciation, on the
most satisfactory principles
hitherto discovered. I now proceed to
some other differences of consequence to
the language, and particularly in America.</p>

<p><i>Gold</i> is differently pronounced by good
speakers, and differently marked by the
standard writers. Two of them give us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<i>goold</i>, as the standard, and three, <i>gold</i> or
<i>goold</i>. But we may find better principles
than the opinions or practice of individuals,
to direct our judgement in this particular.
The word indeed has the pronunciation,
<i>goold</i>, in some of the collateral branches
of the Teutonic, as in the Danish, where
it is spelt <i>guld</i>. But in the Saxon, it was
written <i>gold</i>, and has been uniformly written
so in English. Besides, we have good
reason to believe that it was, in early times,
pronounced <i>gold</i>, with the first sound of <i>o</i>,
for the poets invariably make it rhime with
<i>old</i>, <i>behold</i>, and other words of similar sound.
Thus in Chaucer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With nayles yelwe, and bright as any <i>gold</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hadde a bere's skin, cole blake for old."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Knight's Tale, L. 2143.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Pope:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now Europe's laurels on their brows behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stain'd with blood, or ill exchang'd for <i>gold</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Essay on Man, Book 4.<br />
</p>

<p>The rhime is here a presumptive proof
that the poets pronounced this word with
the first sound of <i>o</i>, and it is a substantial
reason why that pronunciation should be
preferred. But analogy is a still stronger
reason; for bold, told, fold, and I presume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
every similar word in the language, has the
first sound of <i>o</i>. These are good reasons
why <i>gold</i> should have that sound; reasons
which are permanent, and superior to any
private opinions.</p>

<p>Similar reasons, and equally forceable,
are opposed to the modern pronunciation
of <i>wound</i>. I say <i>modern</i>; for in America
<i>woond</i> is a recent innovation. It was perhaps
an ancient dialect; for the old Saxon
and modern Danish orthography warrant
this conjecture.</p>

<p>But in English the spelling has uniformly
corresponded with <i>bound</i>, <i>sound</i>, and
if we may judge from the rhimes of our
poets, the pronunciation has also been analogous.
Thus in Skelton's Elegy on Henry,
Earl of Northumberland, 1489, we
have the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Most noble erle! O foul mysurd<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon he gat his finall deadly <i>wounde</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Rel. An. Eng. Poet. vol. 1. page 113.<br />
</p>

<p>So in a song which seems to have been
written in the reign of Henry VIII.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where griping grefes the hart would <i>wounde</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doleful dumps the mynde oppresse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There musicke with her silver sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With speed is wont to send redresse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Ibm. page 165.<br />
</p>

<p>Similar rhimes occur in almost every
page of modern poetry.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Warriors she fires with animated sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pours balm into the bleeding lover's <i>wounds</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Pope.<br />
</p>

<p>The fashionable pronunciation of <i>wound</i>
destroys the rhime and infringes the rule
of analogy; two objections to it which
can be removed only by universal practice.
Does this practice exist? By no
means. One good authority<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> at least, directs
to the analogous pronunciation; and
another compiler directs to both&mdash;the regular
and the fashionable. But were <i>woond</i>
the universal practice in Great Britain, this
should not induce us to lay aside our own
practice for a foreign one. There is but
a small part, even of the well bred people
in this country, who have yet adopted the
English mode; and the great body of the
people uniformly pursue analogy. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>authority of practice therefore, is, in this
country, opposed to the innovation. Shall
we then relinquish what every man must
acknowlege to be <i>right</i>, to embrace the
corruptions of a foreign court and stage?
Will not the Atlantic ocean, the total separation
of America from Great Britain, the
pride of an independent nation, the rules
of the language, the melody of English poetry,
restrain our rage for imitating the errors
of foreigners?</p>

<p>But it is said that <i>woond</i> is softer than
<i>wound</i>, and therefore more agreeable. Suppose
the assertion to be true, will it follow
that the softest pronunciation should be
preferred?</p>

<p>It is acknowleged on all hands, that a
correspondence between sound and sense is
a beauty in language, and there are many
words in our language, the sounds of which
were borrowed from the sensible objects, the
ideas of which they are designed to express.
Such are the <i>dashing</i> of waters, the <i>crackling</i>
of burning faggots, the <i>hissing</i> of serpents,
the <i>lisping</i> of infants, and the <i>stuttering</i>
of a <i>stammerer</i>. These are considered
as beauties in a language. But there are
other words, the sounds of which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
adopted in imitating audible noises, which
are either soft or harsh, and by the help of
association are particularly calculated to
express ideas, which are either agreeable or
disagreeable to the mind. Of this kind are
<i>soft</i> and <i>harsh</i>, <i>sweet</i> and <i>sour</i>, and a multitude
of others. On the supposition therefore,
that <i>woond</i> is the softer pronunciation,
this is a good reason why it should
<i>not</i> be adopted; for the idea it conveys is
extremely disagreeable, and much better
represented by a harsh word.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><i>Skeptic</i> for <i>sceptic</i> is mere pedantry; a
modern change that has no advantage for
its object. The Greek derivation will be
pleaded as an authority; but this will
not warrant the innovation, without extending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>it to <i>scene</i>, <i>scepter</i>, and many others.
Will the advocates write and pronounce
the latter <i>skene</i>, <i>skepter</i>? If not,
they should be satisfied with analogy and
former practice. It is remarkable however,
that notwithstanding the authority of
almost all the modern dictionaries is in
favor of skeptic, no writer of reputation,
whose works I have seen, has followed the
spelling. The old orthography, <i>sceptic</i>,
still maintains its ground.</p>

<p><i>Sauce</i> with the fourth sound of <i>a</i> is accounted
vulgar; yet this is the ancient,
the correct, and the most general pronunciation.
The <i>aw</i> of the North Britons is
much affected of late; <i>sawce</i>, <i>hawnt</i>, <i>vawnt</i>;
yet the true sound is that of <i>aunt</i>, <i>jaunt</i>,
and a change can produce no possible advantage.</p>

<p>The words <i>advertisement</i> and <i>chastisement</i>
are differently accented by the standard
authors, and by people on both sides of the
Atlantic. Let us find the analogy. The
original words, <i>advertise</i> and <i>chastise</i>, are
verbs, accented uniformly on the last syllable.
Let us search thro the language for
verbs of this description, and I presume we
shall not find another instance, where, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
nouns formed from such verbs, by the addition
of <i>ment</i>, the seat of the accent is
changed. We find amusement, refinement,
refreshment, reconcilement, and many,
perhaps all others, preserve the accent of
their primitives; and in this analogy we
find the reason why <i>chastisement</i> and <i>advertisement</i>
should be accented on the last syllable
but one. This analogy is a substantial
and permanent rule, that will forever
be superior to local customs.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Similar remarks may be made respecting
<i>acceptable</i>, <i>admirable</i>, <i>disputable</i>, <i>comparable</i>,
which our polite speakers accent on
the first syllable. The first is indeed accented
on the second syllable, by most authors,
except Sheridan, who still retains
the accent on the first.</p>

<p>It was an old rule of grammarians, that
the genius of our language requires the accent
to be carried as far as possible towards
the beginning of the word. This
is seldom or never true; on the contrary,
the rule is directly opposed to the melody,
both of poetry and prose. Under the influence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>however, of this rule, a long catalogue
of words lost their true pronunciation,
and among the rest, a great number
of adjectives derived from verbs by an addition
of the termination <i>able</i>. Some of
these are restored to their analogy; others
retain the accent on the first syllable.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the authority of
Sheridan, I presume few people will contend
for the privilege of accenting <i>acceptable</i>
on the first syllable. How the organs
of any man can be brought to articulate
so many consonants in the weak syllables,
or how the ear can relish such an unnatural
pronunciation, is almost inconceiveable.
In spite of the pedantry of scholars,
the ease and melody of speaking, have
almost wholly banished the absurd practice,
by restoring the accent to the second
syllable.</p>

<p>But with respect to <i>admirable</i>, <i>comparable</i>
and <i>disputable</i>, the authors who are
deemed authorities are divided; some are
in favor of the accent on the first syllable,
and others adhere to analogy.</p>

<p>Setting aside custom, every reason for
accenting these words on the first syllable,
will apply with equal force to <i>adviseable</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<i>inclineable</i>, <i>requireable</i>, and a hundred others.
They are all formed from verbs accented
on the last syllable, by annexing the
<i>same</i> termination to the verb, and they are
all of the <i>same</i> part of speech. Let us examin
them by the rules for accentuation, laid
down in the preceding dissertation.</p>

<p>The primitive verbs of this class of
words are usually compounded of a particle
and principal part of speech; as <i>ad-mi-ro</i>,
<i>com-paro</i>, <i>re-qu&aelig;ro</i>, &amp;c. The last syllable,
derived from a verb, is the most important,
and in the primitives, is invariably
accented. This is agreeable to the first
rule. In nine tenths of the derivatives,
the same syllable retains the accent; as,
<i>perceiveable</i>, <i>available</i>, <i>deploreable</i>. In these
therefore both rules are observed. The
third rule, or that which arises from the
terminating syllable, is also preserved in
most of this class of words. It is therefore
much to be regretted, that a false rule
should have introduced an irregularity into
the language, by excepting a few words
from an analogy, which unites in itself every
principle of propriety.</p>

<p>But the practice, with respect to the
three words under consideration, is by no
means general. I have taken particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
notice of the pronunciation of people in
every part of America, and can testify that,
in point of numbers, the practice is in favor
of analogy. The people at large say
<i>admi'reable</i>, <i>dispu'teable</i>, <i>compa'reable</i>; and
it would be difficult to lead them from this
easy and natural pronunciation, to embrace
that forced one of <i>ad'mirable</i>, &amp;c.
The people are right, and, in this particular,
will ever have it to boast of, that among
the unlearned is found the purity of English
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Of this class of words, there are a few
which seem to be corrupted in universal
practice; as <i>reputable</i>. The reason why the
accent in this word is more generally confirmed
on the first syllable, may be this;
there is but a single consonant between the
first and second syllable, and another between
the second and third; so that the
pronunciation of the three weak syllables is
by no means difficult. This word therefore,
in which all authors, and as far as I know,
all men, agree to lay the accent on the first
syllable, and the orthography of which renders
the pronunciation easy, must perhaps be
admitted as an exception to the general rule.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Accessary</i> or <i>accessory</i>, are differently accented
by the best writers and speakers.
But the ease of speaking requires that they
should follow the rule of derivation, and
retain the accent of the primitive, <i>access'ary</i>.</p>

<p>The fashionable pronunciation of such
words as <i>immediate</i>, <i>ministerial</i>, <i>commodious</i>,
is liable to particular exceptions. That <i>i</i>
has a liquid sound, like <i>y</i>, in many words
in our language, is not disputed; but the
classes of words which will admit this
sound, ought to be ascertained. It appears
to me that common practice has determined
this point. If we attend to the pronunciation
of the body of people, who are
led by their own ease rather than by a nice
regard to fashion, we shall find that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
make <i>i</i> liquid, or give it the sound of <i>y</i> consonant,
after those consonants only, which
admit that sound without any change of
their own powers. These consonants are
<i>l</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>v</i>, and the double consonant <i>x</i>; as
<i>valiant</i>, <i>companion</i>, <i>behavior</i>, <i>flexion</i>. Here
<i>y</i> might be substituted for <i>i</i>, without any
change, or any tendency to a change, of
the preceding consonant; except perhaps
the change of <i>si</i> in <i>flexion</i> into <i>sh</i>, which is
a general rule in the language, as it is to
change <i>ti</i> and <i>ci</i> into the same sound.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>But when <i>i</i> is preceded by <i>d</i>, change it
into <i>y</i>, and we cannot pronounce it with
our usual rapidity, without blending the
two letters into the sound of <i>j</i>, which is a
compound of <i>dzh</i>; at least it cannot be effected
without a violent exertion of the
speaker. <i>Immedyate</i> is so difficult, that every
person who attempts to pronounce it
in that manner, will fall into <i>immejate</i>.
Thus <i>commodious</i>, <i>comedian</i>, <i>tragedian</i>, are
very politely pronounced <i>commojus</i>, <i>comejan</i>,
<i>trajejan</i>. Such a pronunciation, changing
the true powers of the letters, and introducing
a harsh union of consonants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><i>dxh</i>, in the place of the smooth sound of
<i>dia</i>, must be considered as a palpable corruption.</p>

<p>With respect to the terminations <i>ial</i>,
<i>ian</i>, &amp;c. after <i>r</i>, I must believe it impossible
to blend these letters in one syllable.
In the word <i>ministerial</i>, for example, I cannot
conceive how <i>ial</i> can be pronounced
<i>yal</i>, without a pause after the syllables,
<i>minister-</i>. Sheridan's manner of pronouncing
the letters <i>ryan</i>, <i>ryal</i>, in a syllable, appears
to be a gross absurdity: Even allowing
<i>y</i> to have the sound of <i>e</i>, we must of
necessity articulate two syllables.</p>

<p>But supposing the modern pronunciation
of <i>immediate</i> to be liable to none of
these exceptions, there is another objection
to it, arising from the construction of our
poetry. To the short syllables of such
words as <i>every</i>, <i>glorious</i>, <i>different</i>, <i>bowery</i>,
<i>commodious</i>, <i>harmonious</i>, <i>happier</i>, <i>ethereal</i>,
<i>immediate</i>, <i>experience</i>, our poetry is in a
great measure indebted for the <i>Dactyl</i>, the
<i>Amphibrach</i>, and the <i>Anap&aelig;st</i>, feet which
are necessary to give variety to versification,
and the last of which is the most flowing,
melodious and forceable foot in the language.
By blending the two short syllables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
into one, we make the foot an Iambic;
and as our poetry consists principally of
iambics, we thus reduce our heroic verse
to a dull uniformity. Take for example
the following line of Pope.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">That</span> sees immediate good by present sense"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we pronounce it thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">That</span> sees | imme|jate good | by pres|ent sense;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the line will be composed entirely of Iambics.
But read it thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">That</span> sees | imme|di-ate good | by pres|ent sense;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the third foot, becoming an anap&aelig;st,
gives variety to the verse.</p>

<p>In the following line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Some</span> happier island in the watery waste:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we read <i>happier</i> and <i>watry</i>, as words
of two syllables, the feet will all be Iambics,
except the third, which is a <i>Pyrrhic</i>.
But if we read <i>happier</i> and <i>watery</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> in three
syllables, as we ought, we introduce two
anap&aelig;sts, and give variety and flowing
melody to the verse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>These remarks will be more fully confirmed
by attending to the last verse of the
following distich:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In martial pomp he clothes the angelic train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While warring myr|iads shake | the ethe|rial plain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Philosophic Solitude.<br />
</p>

<p>On Sheridan's principles, and by an elision
of <i>e</i> in <i>the</i>, the last line is composed of
pure Iambics; whereas in fact, the three
last feet are anap&aelig;sts; and to these the
verse is, in some measure, indebted for its
melody and the sublimity of the description.</p>

<p>These considerations are directly opposed
to the fashionable pronunciation of <i>immediate</i>,
and that whole analogy of words.
In addition to this, I may remark, that it is
not the practice of people in general. Whatever
may be the character and rank of its
advocates, in this country they compose
but a small part, even of the literati.</p>


<h3><i>Of</i> MODERN CORRUPTIONS <i>in the</i>
ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION.</h3>

<p>I proceed now to examin a mode
of pronouncing certain words, which prevails
in England and some parts of America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and which, as it extends to a vast number
of words, and creates a material difference
between the orthography and pronunciation,
is a matter of serious consequence.</p>

<p>To attack established customs is always
hazardous; for mankind, even when they
see and acknowlege their errors, are seldom
obliged to the man who exposes them.
The danger is encreased, when an opposition
is made to the favorite opinions of the
great; for men, whose rank and abilities
entitle them to particular respect, will
sooner dismiss their friends than their prejudices.
Under this conviction, my present
situation is delicate and embarrassing:
But as some sacrifices must often be made
to truth; and as I am conscious that a regard
to truth only dictates what I write, I
can sincerely declare, it is my wish to
inform the understanding of every man,
without wounding the feelings of an individual.</p>

<p>The practice to which I allude, is that
of pronouncing <i>d</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>s</i> preceding <i>u</i>;
which letter, it is said, contains the sound
of <i>e</i> or <i>y</i> and <i>oo</i>; and that of course <i>education</i>
must be pronounced <i>edyucation</i>; <i>na</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span><i>ture</i>,
<i>natyure</i>; and <i>superior</i>, <i>syuperior</i>: From
the difficulty of pronouncing which, we
naturally fall into the sound of <i>dzh</i>, <i>tsh</i>,
and <i>sh</i>: Thus education becomes <i>edzhucation</i>
or <i>ejucation</i>; nature becomes <i>natshure</i>
or <i>nachure</i>; and superior becomes <i>shuperior</i>.</p>

<p>How long this practice has prevailed in
London, I cannot ascertain. There are a
few words, in which it seems to have been
universal from time immemorial; as, <i>pleasure</i>,
and the other words of that analogy.
But I find no reason to suppose the practice
of pronouncing <i>nature</i>, <i>duty</i>, <i>nachure</i>, <i>juty</i>,
prevailed before the period of Garrick's
reputation on the stage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the writers on the
language have been silent upon this point,
till within a few years; and Kenrick speaks
of it as a <i>Metropolitan pronunciation</i>, supported
by <i>certain mighty fine speakers</i>,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
which implies that the practice is modern,
and proves it to be local, even in Great
Britain. But the practice has prevailed at
court and on the stage for several years, and
the reputation of a Garrick, a Sheridan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>and a Siddons, has given it a very rapid
and extensive diffusion in the polite world.
As the innovation is great and extends to
a multitude of words, it is necessary, before
we embrace the practice in its utmost latitude,
to examin into its propriety and consequences.</p>

<p>The only reasons offered in support of
the practice, are, the English or Saxon
sound of <i>u</i>, which is said to be <i>yu</i>; and
<i>euphony</i>, or the agreeableness of the pronunciation.</p>

<p>But permit me to enquire, on what do
the advocates of this practice ground their
assertion, that <i>u</i> had in Saxon the sound of
<i>eu</i> or <i>yu</i>? Are there any testimonies to
support it, among old writers of authority?
In the course of my reading I have
discovered none, nor have I ever seen one
produced or referred to.</p>

<p>Will it be said, that <i>yu</i> is the name of
the letter? But where did this name originate?
Certainly not in the old Saxon
practice, for the Saxons expressed this sound
by <i>ew</i>, or <i>eo</i>: And I do not recollect a single
word of Saxon origin, in which the
warmest sticklers for the practice, give <i>u</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
this sound, even in the present age. Kenrick,
who has investigated the powers of
the English letters with much more accuracy
than even Sheridan himself, observes,
that we might with equal propriety, name
the other vowels in the same manner, and
say, <i>ya</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>yi</i>, <i>yo</i>, as well as <i>yu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><i>U</i> in <i>union</i>, <i>use</i>, &amp;c. has the sound of <i>yu</i>;
but these are all of <i>Latin</i> origin, and can
be no proof that <i>u</i> had, in <i>Saxon</i>, the sound
of <i>ew</i> or <i>yu</i>.</p>

<p>The whole argument is founded on a mistake.
<i>U</i> in pure English has not the sound
of <i>ew</i>, but a sound that approaches it;
which is defined with great accuracy by the
learned Wallis, who was one of the first
correct writers upon English Grammar,
and whose treatise is the foundation
of Lowth's Introduction and all the best
subsequent compilations.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>This writer defines the English letter
<i>u</i> in these words, "Hunc sonum Extranei
sere assequenter, si dipthongum <i>iu</i> conentur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>pronunciare; nempe <i>i</i> exile liter&aelig;
<i>u</i>, vel <i>w</i> preponentes; (ut in Hispanorum
ciudad, civitas.) <i>Non tamen idem est omnino
sonus, quamvis, ad illum proxime, accedat</i>; est
enim <i>iu</i> sonus compositus, at Anglorum et
Gallorum <i>u</i> sonus simplex."<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;&mdash; Gram.
Ling. Angl. Sect. 2.</p>

<p>This is precisely the idea I have ever had
of the English <i>u</i>; except that I cannot allow
the sound to be perfectly simple. If
we attend to the manner in which we begin
the sound of <i>u</i> in <i>flute</i>, <i>abjure</i>, <i>truth</i>, we
shall observe that the tongue is not pressed
to the mouth so closely as in pronouncing
<i>e</i>; the aperture of the organs is not so
small; and I presume that good speakers,
and am confident that most people, do not
pronounce these words <i>fleute</i>, <i>abjeure</i>, <i>treuth</i>.
Neither do they pronounce them <i>floote</i>, <i>abjoore</i>,
<i>trooth</i>; but with a sound formed by an
easy natural aperture of the mouth, between
<i>iu</i> and <i>oo</i>; which is the true English sound.
This sound, however obscured by affectation
in the metropolis of Great Britain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>the capital towns in America, is still preserved
by the body of the people in both
countries. There are a million descendants
of the Saxons in this country who retain
the sound of <i>u</i> in all cases, precisely
according to Wallis's definition. Ask any
plain countryman, whose pronunciation
has not been exposed to corruption by
mingling with foreigners, how he pronounces
the letters, <i>t</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>th</i>, and he will
not sound <i>u</i> like <i>eu</i>, nor <i>oo</i>, but will express
the real primitive English <i>u</i>. Nay, if people
wish to make an accurate trial, let them
direct any child of seven years old, who
has had no previous instruction respecting
the matter, to pronounce the words <i>suit</i>,
<i>tumult</i>, <i>due</i>, &amp;c. and they will thus ascertain
the true sound of the letter. Children
pronounce <i>u</i> in the most natural manner;
whereas the sound of <i>iu</i> requires a considerable
effort, and that of <i>oo</i>, a forced position
of the lips. Illiterate persons therefore
pronounce the genuin English <i>u</i>, much
better than those who have attempted to
shape their pronunciation according to the
polite modern practice. As singular as
this assertion may appear, it is literally
true. This circumstance alone would be
sufficient to prove that the Saxons never
pronounced <i>u</i> like <i>yu</i>; for the body of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
nation, removed from the reach of conquest
and free from a mixture of foreigners,
are the safest repositories of ancient
customs and general practice in speaking.</p>

<p>But another strong argument against
the modern practice is, that the pretended
dipthong, <i>iu</i> or <i>yu</i>, is heard in scarcely a
single word of Saxon origin. Almost all
the words in which <i>d</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>s</i> are converted
into other letters, as <i>education</i>, <i>due</i>, <i>virtue</i>,
<i>rapture</i>, <i>superior</i>, <i>supreme</i>, &amp;c. are derived
from the Latin or French; so that
the practice itself is a proof that the principles
on which it is built, are false. It is
pretended that the English or Saxon sound
of <i>u</i> requires the pronunciation, <i>edzhucation</i>,
<i>natshure</i>, and yet it is introduced almost
solely into Latin and French words.
Such an inconsistency refutes the reasoning
and is a burlesque on its advocates.</p>

<p>This however is but a small part of the
inconsistency. In two other particulars
the absurdity is still more glaring.</p>

<p>1. The modern refiners of our language
distinguish two sounds of <i>u</i> long; that of
<i>yu</i> and <i>oo</i>; and use both without any regard
to Latin or Saxon derivation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
distinction they make is founded on a certain
principle; and yet I question whether
one of a thousand of them ever attended
to it. After most of the consonants,
they give <i>u</i> the dipthongal sound of <i>eu</i>;
as in <i>blue</i>, <i>cube</i>, <i>due</i>, <i>mute</i>; but after <i>r</i> they
almost invariably pronounce it <i>oo</i>; as <i>rule</i>,
<i>truth</i>, <i>rue</i>, <i>rude</i>, <i>fruit</i>. Why this distinction?
If they contend for the Saxon sound
of <i>u</i>, why do they not preserve that sound
in <i>true</i>, <i>rue</i>, <i>truth</i>, which are of Saxon original;
and uniformly give <i>u</i> its Roman
sound, which is acknowleged on all hands to
have been <i>oo</i>, in all words of Latin original,
as <i>rule</i>, <i>mute</i>, <i>cube</i>? The fact is, they mistake
the principle on which the distinction
is made; and which is merely accidental,
or arises from the ease of speaking.</p>

<p>In order to frame many of the consonants,
the organs are placed in such a position,
that in passing from it to the aperture necessary
to articulate the following vowel or
dipthong, we insensibly fall into the sound
of <i>ee</i>. This in particular is the case with
those consonants which are formed near
the seat of <i>e</i>; viz. <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>. The closing
of the organs forms these mutes; and a very
small opening forms the vowel <i>e</i>. In passing
from that close compression occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
by <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, to the aperture necessary to
form any vowel, the organs are necessarily
placed in a situation to pronounce <i>ee</i>. From
this single circumstance, have originated
the most barbarous dialects or singularities
in speaking English, which offend the ear,
either in Great Britain or America.</p>

<p>This is the origin of the New England
<i>keow</i>, <i>keoward</i>; and of the English <i>keube</i>,
<i>ackeuse</i>, <i>keind</i> and <i>geuide</i>.</p>

<p>There is just the same propriety in one
practice as the other, and both are equally
harmonious.</p>

<p>For similar reasons, the labials, <i>m</i>
and <i>p</i>, are followed by <i>e</i>: In New England,
we hear it in <i>meow</i>, <i>peower</i>, and
in Great Britain, in <i>meute</i>, <i>peure</i>. With
this difference however, that in New England,
this pronunciation is generally confined
to the more illiterate part of the people,
and in Great Britain it prevails among
those of the first rank. But after <i>r</i> we
never hear the sound of <i>e</i>: It has been before
observed, that the most awkward countryman
in New England pronounces <i>round</i>,
<i>ground</i>, <i>brown</i>, as correctly as men of the
first education; and our fashionable speakers
pronounce <i>u</i> after <i>r</i> like <i>oo</i>. The rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>son
is the same in both cases: In pronouncing
<i>r</i> the mouth is necessarily opened (or
rather the glottis) to a position for articulating
a broad full sound. So that the vulgar
singularities in this respect, and the polite
refinements of speaking, both proceed
from the same cause; both proceed from
an accidental or careless narrow way of
articulating certain combinations of letters;
both are corruptions of pure English; equally
disagreeable and indefensible. Both
may be easily corrected by taking more
pains to open the teeth, and form full bold
sounds.</p>

<p>2. But another inconsistency in the
modern practice, is the introducing an <i>e</i><a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
before the second sound of <i>u</i> as in <i>tun</i>; or
rather changing the preceding consonant;
for in <i>nature</i>, <i>rapture</i>, and hundreds of
other words, <i>t</i> is changed into <i>tsh</i>; and yet
no person pretends that <i>u</i>, in these words,
has a dipthongal sound. On the other
hand, Sheridan and his copier, Scott, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>in these and similar words marked <i>u</i> for its
short sound, which is universally acknowleged
to be simple. I believe no person
ever pretended, that this sound of <i>u</i> contains
the sound of <i>e</i> or <i>y</i>; why then should
we be directed to pronounce <i>nature</i>, <i>natyur</i>?
Or what is equally absurd, <i>natshur</i>?
On what principle is the <i>t</i> changed into a
compound consonant? If there is any thing
in this sound of <i>u</i> to warrant this change,
does it not extend to all words where this
sound occurs? Why do not our standard
writers direct us to say <i>tshun</i> for <i>tun</i>, and
<i>tshumble</i> for <i>tumble</i>? I can conceive no reason
which will warrant the pronunciation
in one case, that will not apply with equal
force in the other. And I challenge the
advocates of the practice, to produce a
reason for pronouncing <i>natshur</i>, <i>raptshur</i>,
<i>captshur</i>, which will not extend to authorize,
not only <i>tshun</i>, <i>tshurn</i>, for <i>tun</i>, <i>turn</i>, but
also <i>fatshal</i> for <i>fatal</i>, and <i>immortshal</i> for <i>immortal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Nay, the latter pronunciation is
actually heard among some very respectable
imitators of fashion; and is frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>among the illiterate, in those states where
the <i>tshu's</i> are most fashionable. How can
it be otherwise? People are led by imitation;
and when those in high life embrace
a singularity, the multitude, who are unacquainted
with its principles or extent,
will attempt to imitate the novelty, and
probably carry it much farther than was
ever intended.</p>

<p>When a man of little education hears
a respectable gentleman change <i>t</i> into <i>tsh</i>
in nature, he will naturally be led to change
the same letter, not only in that word, but
wherever it occurs. This is already done
in a multitude of instances, and the practice
if continued and extended, might eventually
change <i>t</i>, in all cases, into <i>tsh</i>.</p>

<p>I am sensible that some writers of novels
and plays have ridiculed the common
pronunciation of <i>creatur</i> and <i>nutur</i>, by introducing
these and similar words into low
characters, spelling them <i>creater</i>, <i>nater</i>:
And the supporters of the court pronunciation
allege, that in the vulgar practice of
speaking, the letter <i>e</i> is sounded and not <i>u</i>:
So extremely ignorant are they of the nature
of sounds and the true powers of the
English letters. The fact is, we are so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from pronouncing e in the common pronunciation
of <i>natur</i>, <i>creatur</i>, &amp;c. that <i>e</i> is
always sounded like short <i>u</i>, in the unaccented
syllables of <i>over</i>, <i>sober</i>, <i>banter</i>, and
other similar words. Nay, most of the
vowels, in such syllables, sound like <i>i</i> or <i>u</i>
short.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Liar, elder, factor, are pronounced
<i>liur</i>, <i>eldur</i>, <i>factur</i>, and this is the true
sound of <i>u</i> in <i>creatur</i>, <i>nature</i>, <i>rapture</i>, <i>legislature</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I would just observe further, that this
pretended dipthong <i>iu</i> was formerly expressed
by <i>ew</i> and <i>eu</i>, or perhaps by <i>eo</i>, and
was considered as different from the sound
of <i>u</i>. In modern times, we have, in many
words, blended the sound of <i>u</i> with that of
<i>ew</i>, or rather use them promiscuously. It
is indifferent, as to the pronunciation,
whether we write <i>fuel</i> or <i>fewel</i>. And yet
in this word, as also in <i>new</i>, <i>brew</i>, &amp;c. we
do not hear the sound of <i>e</i>, except among
the Virginians, who affect to pronounce
it distinctly, <i>ne-ew</i>, <i>ne-oo</i>, <i>fe-oo</i>. This affectation
is not of modern date, for Wallis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>mentions it in his time and reprobates it.
"Eu, ew, eau, sonanter per <i>e</i> clarum et
<i>w</i>; ut in <i>neuter</i>, <i>few</i>, <i>beauty</i>. Quidem tamen
accutius efferunt, acsi scriberentur
<i>niew ter</i>, <i>fiew</i>, <i>bieuty</i>. At prior pronunciatio
rectior est."&mdash;&mdash;Gram. Ling. Ang.</p>

<p>Here this author allows these combinations
to have the sound of <i>yu</i> or <i>iu</i>; but
disapproves of that refinement which some
affect, in giving the <i>e</i> or <i>i</i> short its distinct
sound.</p>

<p>The true sound of the English <i>u</i>, is neither
<i>ew</i>, with the distinct sounds of <i>e</i> and
<i>oo</i>; nor is it <i>oo</i>; but it is that sound which
every unlettered person utters in pronouncing
<i>solitude</i>, <i>rude</i>, <i>threw</i>, and which cannot
easily be mistaken. So difficult is it to avoid
the true sound of <i>u</i>, that I have never
found a man, even among the ardent admirers
of the stage pronunciation, who
does not retain the vulgar sound, in more
than half the words of this class which he
uses. There is such a propensity in men
to be regular in the construction and use
of language, that they are often obliged,
by the customs of the age, to struggle against
their inclination, in order to be
wrong, and still find it impossible to be uniform
in their errors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>The other reason given to vindicate the
polite pronunciation, is <i>euphony</i>. But I
must say with Kenrick,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> I cannot discover
the euphony; on the contrary, the pronunciation
is to me both disagreeable and
difficult. It is certainly more difficult to
pronounce two consonants than one. <i>Ch</i>,
or, which is the same thing, <i>tsh</i>, is a more
difficult sound than <i>t</i>; and <i>dzh</i>, or <i>j</i>, more
difficult than <i>d</i>. Any accurate ear may
perceive the difference in a single word, as
in <i>natur</i>, <i>nachur</i>. But when two or three
words meet, in which we have either of
these compound sounds, the difficulty becomes
very obvious; as the <i>nachural feachurs
of indivijuals</i>. The difficulty is increased,
when two of these <i>churs</i> and <i>jurs</i> occur
in the same word. Who can pronounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>these words, "at this <i>junctshur</i> it
was <i>conjectshured</i>"&mdash;or "the act passed in a
<i>tshumultshuous legislatshur</i>," without a pause,
or an extreme exertion of the lungs? If
this is euphony to an English ear, I know
not what sounds in language can be disagreeable.
To me it is barbarously harsh
and unharmonious.</p>

<p>But supposing the pronunciation to be
relished by ears accustomed to it (for custom
will familiarize any thing) will the
pleasure which individuals experience, balance
the ill effects of creating a multitude
of irregularities? Is not the number of anomalies
in our language already sufficient,
without an arbitrary addition of many hundreds?
Is not the difference between our
written and spoken language already sufficiently
wide, without changing the sounds
of a number of consonants?</p>

<p>If we attend to the irregularities which
have been long established in our language,
we shall find most of them in the Saxon
branch. The Roman tongue was almost
perfectly regular, and perhaps its orthography
and pronunciation were perfectly
correspondent. But it is the peculiar misfortune
of the fashionable practice of pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>nouncing
<i>d</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>s</i>, before <i>u</i>, that it destroys
the analogy and regularity of the
<i>Roman</i> branch of our language; for those
consonants are not changed in many words
of Saxon original. Before this affectation
prevailed, we could boast of a regular orthography
in a large branch of our language;
but now the only class of words,
which had preserved a regular construction,
are attacked, and the correspondence between
the spelling and pronunciation, destroyed,
by those who ought to have been
the first to oppose the innovation.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Should this practice be extended to all
words, where <i>d</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>s</i> precede <i>u</i>, as it
must before it can be consistent or defensible,
it would introduce more anomalies
into our tongue, than were before established,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>both in the orthography and construction.
What a perverted taste, and
what a singular ambition must those men
possess, who, in the day light of civilization
and science, and in the short period of
an age, can go farther in demolishing the
analogies of an elegant language, than
their unlettered ancestors proceeded in centuries,
amidst the accidents of a savage life,
and the shocks of numerous invasions!</p>

<p>But it will be replied, <i>Custom is the legislator
of language</i>, and custom authorizes
the practice I am reprobating. A man can
hardly offer a reason, drawn from the principles
of analogy and harmony in a language,
but he is instantly silenced with the
decisive, <i>jus et norma loquendi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>
<p>What then is custom? Some writer
has already answered this question; "Custom
is the plague of wise men and the idol
of fools." This was probably said of those
customs and fashions which are capricious
and varying; for there are many customs,
founded on propriety, which are permanent
and constitute laws.</p>

<p>But what kind of custom did Horace
design to lay down as the standard of speaking?
Was it a local custom? Then the
<i>keow</i> of New England; the <i>oncet</i> and <i>twicet</i>
of Pennsylvania and Maryland; and the
<i>keind</i> and <i>skey</i> of the London theaters, form
rules of speaking. Is it the practice of a
court, or a few eminent scholars and orators,
that he designed to constitute a standard?
But who shall determine what body
of men forms this uncontrollable legislature?
Or who shall reconcile the differences
at court? For these eminent orators
often disagree. There are numbers of
words in which the most eminent men differ:
Can all be right? Or what, in this case,
is the <i>custom</i> which is to be our guide?</p>

<p>Besides these difficulties, what right
have a few men, however elevated their station,
to change a national practice? They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
may say, that they consult their own ears,
and endeavor to please themselves. This
is their only apology, unless they can prove
that the changes they make are real improvements.
But what improvement is
there in changing the sounds of three or
four letters into others, and thus multiplying
anomalies, and encreasing the difficulty
of learning a language? Will not
the great body of the people claim the
privilege of adhering to their ancient usages,
and believing their practice to be the
most correct? They most undoubtedly
will.</p>

<p>If Horace's maxim is ever just, it is only
when custom is national; when the
practice of a nation is uniform or general.
In this case it becomes the common law of
the land, and no one will dispute its propriety.
But has any man a right to deviate
from this practice, and attempt to establish
a singular mode of his own? Have
two or three eminent stage players authority
to make changes at pleasure, and
palm their novelties upon a nation under
the idea of <i>custom</i>? The reader will pardon
me for transcribing here the opinion of the
celebrated Michaelis, one of the most learned
philologers of the present century. "It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
is not," says he, "for a scholar to give laws
nor proscribe established expressions: If
he takes so much on himself he is ridiculed,
and deservedly; it is no more than a just
mortification to his ambition, and the penalty
of his usurping on the rights of the
people. Language is a democratical state,
where all the learning in the world does
not warrant a citizen to supersede a received
custom, till he has convinced the whole
nation that this custom is a mistake. Scholars
are not so infallible that every thing is
to be referred to them. Were they allowed
a decisory power, the errors of language,
I am sure, instead of diminishing, would
be continually increasing. Learned heads
teem with them no less than the vulgar;
and the former are much more imperious,
that we should be compelled to defer to
their innovations and implicitly to receive
every false opinion of theirs."<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Yet this right is often assumed by individuals,
who dictate to a nation the rules
of speaking, with the same imperiousness
as a tyrant gives laws to his vassals: And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>strange as it may appear, even well bred
people and scholars, often surrender their
right of private judgement to these literary
governors. The <i>ipse dixit</i> of a Johnson,
a Garrick, or a Sheridan, has the force of
law; and to contradict it, is rebellion. Ask
the most of our learned men, how they
would pronounce a word or compose a sentence,
and they will immediately appeal to
some favorite author whose decision is final.
Thus distinguished eminence in a
writer often becomes a passport for innumerable
errors.</p>

<p>The whole evil originates in a fallacy.
It is often supposed that certain great men
are infallible, or that their practice constitutes
custom and the rule of propriety.
But on the contrary, any man, however
learned, is liable to mistake; the most
learned, as Michaelis observes, often teem
with errors, and not unfrequently become
attached to particular systems, and imperious
in forcing them upon the world.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It
is not the particular whim of such men,
that constitutes <i>custom</i>; but the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>practice of a nation, which is conformed
to their <i>general</i> ideas of propriety. The
pronunciation of <i>keow</i>, <i>keind</i>, <i>drap</i>, <i>juty</i>,
<i>natshur</i>, &amp;c. are neither right nor wrong,
because they are approved or censured by
particular men; nor because one is local
in New England, another in the middle
states, and the others are supported by the
court and stage in London. They are
wrong, because they are opposed to national
practice; they are wrong, because they
are arbitrary or careless changes of the true
sounds of our letters; they are wrong,
because they break in upon the regular
construction of the language; they are
wrong, because they render the pronunciation
difficult both for natives and foreigners;
they are wrong, because they make
an invidious distinction between the polite
and common pronunciation, or else oblige
a <i>nation</i> to change their general customs,
without presenting to their view one <i>national</i>
advantage. These are important,
they are permanent considerations; they
are superior to the caprices of courts and
theaters; they are reasons that are interwoven
in the very structure of the language,
or founded on the common law
of the nation; and they are a living satire
upon the licentiousness of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
speakers, who dare to slight their authority.</p>

<p>But let us examin whether the practice
I am censuring is general or not; for if
not, it cannot come within Horace's rule.
If we may believe well informed gentlemen,
it is not general even in Great Britain.
I have been personally informed, and
by gentlemen of education and abilities,
one of whom was particular in his observation,
that it is not general, even among
the most eminent literary characters in
London. It is less frequent in the interior
counties, where the inhabitants still
speak as the common people do in this
country. And Kenrick speaks of it as an
affectation in the metropolis which ought
to be discountenanced.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the practice in
England or Ireland, there are few in America
who have embraced it, as it is explained
in Sheridan's Dictionary. In the middle
and southern states, there are a few, and
those well bred people, who have gone far
in attempting to imitate the fashion of the
day.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Yet the body of the people, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>in these states, remain as unfashionable as
ever; and the eastern states generally adhere
to their ancient custom of speaking,
however vulgar it may be thought by their
neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Suppose custom therefore to
be the <i>jus et norma</i>, the rule of correct
speaking, and in this country, it is directly
opposed to the plan now under consideration.</p>

<p>As a nation, we have a very great interest
in opposing the introduction of any
plan of uniformity with the British language,
even were the plan proposed perfectly
unexceptionable. This point will
be afterwards discussed more particularly;
but I would observe here, that the author
who has the most admirers and imitators
in this country, has been censured in London,
where his character is highly esteemed,
and that too by men who are confessedly
partial to his general plan. In the
critical review of Sheridan's Dictionary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>1781, there are the following exceptions to
his standard.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless our author must not
be surprized if, in a matter, in its nature
so delicate and difficult, as that concerning
which he treats, a doubt should here and
there arise, in the minds of the most candid
critics, with regard to the propriety of
his determinations. For instance, we
would wish him to reconsider, whether, in
the words which begin with <i>super</i>, such as
<i>superstition</i>, <i>supersede</i>, he is right in directing
them to be pronounced <i>shooper</i>. Whatever
might be the case in Queen Anne's
time, it doth not occur to us, that any one
at present, above the lower ranks, speaks
these words with the sound of <i>sh</i>; or that
a good reason can be given, for their being
thus sounded. Nay their being thus spoken
is contrary to Mr. Sheridan's own rule;
for he says that the letter <i>s</i> always preserves
its own proper sound at the beginning of
words."</p>

<p>Here we are informed by this gentleman's
admirers, that, in some instances, he
has imposed upon the world, as the standard
of purity, a pronunciation which is not
heard, except among the <i>lower ranks of peo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>ple</i>,
and directly opposed to his own rule.
The reviewers might have extended their
remarks to many other instances, in which
he has deviated from general practice and
from every rule of the language. Yet at
the voice of this gentleman, many of the
Americans are quitting their former practice,
and running into errors with an eagerness
bordering on infatuation.</p>

<p>Customs of the court and stage, it is
confessed, rule without resistance in monarchies.
But what have we to do with
the customs of a foreign nation? Detached
as we are from all the world, is it not possible
to circumscribe the power of <i>custom</i>,
and lay it, in some degree, under the influence
of propriety? We are sensible that in
foreign courts, a man's reputation may depend
on a genteel bow, and his fortune
may be lost by wearing an unfashionable
coat. But have we advanced to that stage
of corruption, that our highest ambition
is to be as particular in fashions as other
nations? In matters merely indifferent,
like modes of dress, some degree of conformity
to local custom is necessary;<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>when this conformity requires a sacrifice
of any principle of propriety or moral rectitude,
singularity becomes an honorable
testimony of an independent mind. A
man of a great soul would sooner imitate
the virtues of a cottage, than the vices of
a court; and would deem it more honorable
to gain one useful idea from the humble
laborer, than to copy the vicious pronunciation
of a splendid court, or become
an adept in the licentious principles of a
Rochester and a Littleton.</p>

<p>It will not be disputed that Sheridan
and Scott have very faithfully published
the present pronunciation of the English
court and theater. But if we may consult
the rules of our language and consider
them as of any authority; if we may rely
on the opinions of Kenrick and the reviewers;
if we may credit the best informed
people who have travelled in Great Britain,
this practice is modern and local, and
considered, by the judicious and impartial,
even of the English nation, as a gross corruption
of the pure pronunciation.</p>

<p>Such errors and innovations should not
be imitated, because they are found in authors
of reputation. The works of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
authors should rather be considered as
lights to prevent our falling upon the
rocks of error. There is no more propriety
in our imitating the practice of the
English theater, because it is described by
the celebrated Sheridan, than there is in
introducing the manners of Rochester or
the principles of Bolingbroke, because these
were eminent characters; or than there is
in copying the vices of a Shylock, a Lovelace,
or a Richard III. because they are well
described by the masterly pens of Shakespear
and Richardson. So far as the correctness
and propriety of speech are considered
as important, it is of as much consequence
to oppose the introduction of that
practice in this country, as it is to resist the
corruption of morals, which ever attends
the wealthy and luxurious stage of national
refinements.</p>

<p>Had Sheridan adhered to his own rules
and to the principle of analogy; had he
given the world a consistent scheme of pronunciation,
which would not have had,
for its unstable basis, the fickle practice of
a changeable court, he would have done
infinite service to the language: Men of
science, who wish to preserve the regular
construction of the language, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
rejoiced to find such a respectable authority
on the side of propriety; and the illiterate
copiers of fashion must have rejected
faults in speaking, which they could not
defend.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The corruption however has taken such
deep root in England, that there is little
probability it will ever be eradicated. The
practice must there prevail, and gradually
change the whole structure of the Latin
derivatives. Such is the force of custom,
in a nation where all fashionable people
are drawn to a point, that the current of
opinion is irresistible; individuals must
fall into the stream and be borne away by
its violence; except perhaps a few philosophers,
whose fortitude may enable them to
hold their station, and whose sense of propriety
may remain, when their power of
opposition has ceased.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>
<p>But our detached situation, local and
political, gives us the <i>power</i>, while pride,
policy, and a regard for propriety and uniformity
among ourselves, should inspire us
with a <i>disposition</i>, to oppose innovations,
which have not utility for their object.</p>

<p>We shall find it difficult to convince
Englishmen that a corrupt taste prevails
in the British nation. Foreigners view the
Americans with a degree of contempt;
they laugh at our manners, pity our ignorance,
and as far as example and derision
can go, obtrude upon us the customs of
their native countries. But in borrowing
from other nations, we should be exceedingly
cautious to separate their virtues
from their vices; their useful improvements
from their false refinements. Stile
and taste, in all nations, undergo the same
revolutions, the same progress from purity
to corruption, as manners and government;
and in England the pronunciation
of the language has shared the same fate.
The Augustan era is past, and whether
the nation perceive and acknowlege the
truth or not, the world, as impartial spectators,
observe and lament the declension
of taste and science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The nation can do little more than read
the works and admire the beauties of the
original authors, who have adorned the
preceding ages. A few, ambitious of fame,
or driven by necessity, croud their names
into the catalogue of writers, by imitating
some celebrated model, or by compiling
from the productions of genius. Nothing
marks more strongly the declension of genius
in England, than the multitude of
plays, farces, novels and other catchpenny
pieces, which swell the list of modern publications;
and that host of compilers, who,
in the rage for selecting beauties and abridging
the labor of reading, disfigure
the works of the purest writers in the nation.
Cicero did not waste his talents in
barely reading and selecting the beauties of
Demosthenes; and in the days of Addison,
the beauties of Milton, Locke and Shakespear
were to be found only in <i>their works</i>.
But taste is corrupted by luxury; utility
is forgotten in pleasure; genius is buried
in dissipation, or prostituted to exalt and
to damn contending factions, and to amuse
the idle debauchees that surround a
licentious stage.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>These are the reasons why we should
not adopt promiscuously their taste, their
opinions, their manners. Customs, habits,
and <i>language</i>, as well as government should
be national. America should have her
<i>own</i> distinct from all the world. Such is
the policy of other nations, and such must
be <i>our</i> policy, before the states can be either
independent or respectable. To copy
foreign manners implicitly, is to reverse
the order of things, and begin our political
existence with the corruptions and vices
which have marked the declining glories
of other republics.</p>

in pronouncing <i>wind</i> like <i>mind</i>, <i>bind</i>, with the first sound of
<i>i</i>. The Dean's argument was, "I have a great mi<sup>2</sup>nd to fi<sup>2</sup>nd
why you pronounce that word <i>wi<sup>2</sup>nd</i>." I would beg leave
to ask this gentleman, who directs us to say <i>woond</i>, if any
good reason can be <i>foond</i> why he <i>soonds</i> that word <i>woond</i>;
and whether he expects a rational people, will be <i>boond</i> to
follow the <i>roond</i> of court improprieties? We acknowlege
that <i>wi<sup>2</sup>nd</i> is a deviation from analogy and a corruption; but
who pronounces it otherwise? Practice was almost wholly
against Swift, and in America at least, it is as generally in
favor of the analogy of <i>wound</i>. A partial or local practice,
may be brought to support analogy, but should be no authority

Yet <i>dissolvable</i>, <i>indissolvable</i>, <i>repairable</i> and <i>irrepairable</i>, are
better words than <i>indissoluble</i>, <i>reparable</i>, <i>irreparable</i>. They
not only preserve the analogy, but they are more purely
English words; and I have been witness to a circumstance
which alone ought to determine their excellence and give
them currency: People of ordinary education have found
difficulty in understanding such derivatives as <i>irreparable</i>,
<i>indissoluble</i>; but the moment the words <i>irrepairable</i>, <i>indissolveable</i>
are pronounced, they are led to the meaning by a
previous acquaintance with the words <i>repair</i> and <i>dissolve</i>.

His Lectures on Elocution and on Reading, his Treatises

<h3>FORMATION <i>of</i> LANGUAGE.</h3>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/image181c.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> discussed the subject
of pronunciation very
largely in the two preceding
Dissertations, I shall
now examin the <i>use of
words in the construction of
sentences</i>.</p>

<p>Several writers of eminence have attempted
to explain the origin, progress
and structure of languages, and have handled
the subject with great ingenuity and
profound learning; as Harris, Smith, Beatie,
Blair, Condillac, and others. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
discovery of the true theory of the construction
of language, seems to have been
reserved for Mr. Horne Tooke, author of
the "Diversions of Purley." In this treatise,
however exceptionable may be particular
instances of the writer's spirit and
manner, the principles on which the formation
of languages depends, are unfolded
and demonstrated by an etymological analysis
of the Saxon or Gothic origin of
the English particles. From the proofs
which this writer produces, and from various
other circumstances, it appears probable,
that the <i>noun</i> or substantive is the
principal part of speech, and from which
most words are originally derived.</p>

<p>The invention and progress of articulate
sounds must have been extremely slow.
Rude savages have originally no method of
conveying ideas, but by looks, signs, and
those inarticulate sounds, called by grammarians,
<i>Interjections</i>. These are probably
the first beginnings of language. They
are produced by the passions, and are perhaps
very little superior, in point of articulation
or significancy, to the sounds which
express the wants of the brutes.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>But the first sounds, which, by being
often repeated, would become articulate,
would be those which savages use to convey
their ideas of certain visible objects,
which first employ their attention. These
sounds, by constant application to the same
things, would gradually become the <i>names</i>
of those objects, and thus acquire a permanent
signification. In this manner,
rivers, mountains, trees, and such animals
as afford food for savages, would first acquire
names; and next to them, such other
objects as can be noticed or perceived by
the senses. Those names which are given
to ideas called <i>abstract</i> and <i>complex</i>, or, to
speak more correctly, those names which
express a combination of ideas, are invented
much later in the progress of language.
Such are the words, faith, hope, virtue,
genius, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary, and perhaps impossible,
to describe the whole process of the
formation of languages; but we may reason
from the nature of things that the <i>necessary</i>
parts of speech would be the first
formed; and it is very evident from etymology
that all the others are derived from
these, either by abbreviation or combination.
The necessary parts of speech are
the <i>noun</i> and <i>verb</i>; and perhaps we may
add the <i>article</i>. Pronouns are not necessary,
but from their utility, must be a very
early invention.</p>

<p>That the noun and verb are the only
parts of speech, absolutely necessary for a
communication of ideas among rude nations,
will be obvious to any person who
considers their manner of life, and the
small number of their necessary ideas.
Their employments are war and hunting;
and indeed some tribes are so situated as to
have no occupation but that of procuring
subsistence. How few must be the ideas
of a people, whose sole employment is to
catch fish, and take wild beasts for food!
Such nations, and even some much farther
advanced towards civilization, use few
or no prepositions, adverbs and conjunctions,
in their intercourse with each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and very few adjectives. Some tribes of
savages in America use no adjectives at all;
but express qualities by a particular form
of the verb; or rather blend the affirmation
and quality into one word.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> They
have, it is said, some connecting words in
their own languages, some of which have
advanced towards copiousness and variety.
But when they attempt to speak English,
they use nouns and verbs long before they
obtain any knowlege of the particles. They
speak in this manner, go, way&mdash;&mdash; sun,
shine&mdash;&mdash; tree, fall&mdash;&mdash; give, Uncas, rum;
with great deliberation and a short pause
between the words. They omit the connectives
and the abbreviations, which may
be called the "wings of Mercury." Thus
it is evident, that, among such nations, a
few nouns and verbs will answer the purposes
of language.</p>

<p>Many of this kind of expressions remain
in the English language to this day.
<i>Go away</i> is the savage phrase with the article
<i>a</i>, derived perhaps from <i>one</i>, or what is
more probable, added merely to express
the sound, made in the transition from one
word to the other, for if we attend to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>manner in which we pronounce these or
two similar words, we shall observe that
we involuntarily form the sound expressed
by <i>a</i> or <i>aw</i>. In some such manner are
formed <i>astray</i>, <i>awhile</i>, <i>adown</i>, <i>aground</i>, <i>ashore</i>,
<i>above</i>, <i>abaft</i>, <i>among</i>, and many others.
They are usually called adverbs and
prepositions; but they are neither more
nor less than nouns or verbs, with the prefix
<i>a</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> That all the words called adverbs
and prepositions, are derived in like manner,
from the principal parts of language,
the noun and verb, is not demonstrable;
but that <i>most</i> of them are so derived, etymology
clearly proves.</p>


<h3>HORNE TOOKE's THEORY <i>of the</i>
PARTICLES.</h3>

<p>This theory derives great strength from
analizing the words called <i>conjunctions</i>.
It will perhaps surprize those who have not
attended to this subject, to hear it asserted,
that the little conjunction <i>if</i>, is a <i>verb</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>the Imperative Mode. That this is the fact
can no more be controverted than any
point of history, or any truth that our
senses present to the mind. <i>If</i> is radically
the same word as <i>give</i>; it was in the Saxon
Infinitive, <i>gifan</i>, and in the Imperative,
like other Saxon verbs, lost the <i>an</i>; being
written <i>gif</i>. This is the word in its purity;
but in different dialects of the same
radical tongue, we find it written <i>gife</i>, <i>giff</i>,
<i>gi</i>, <i>yf</i>, <i>yef</i>, and <i>yeve</i>. Chaucer used <i>y</i> instead
of <i>g</i>.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unto the devil rough and blake of hewe<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yeve</i> I thy body and my panne also."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Freres Tale, 7204.<br />
</p>

<p>But the true Imperative is <i>gif</i>, as in the
Sad Shepherd. Act 2. Sc. 2.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">&mdash;&mdash;"My largesse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath lotted her to be your brother's mistress<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gif</i> she can be reclaimed; <i>gif</i> not, his prey."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the origin of the conjunction <i>if</i>;
and it answers, in sense and derivation to
the Latin <i>si</i>, which is but a contraction of
<i>sit</i>. Thus what we denominate the Subjunctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>mode is resolvable into the Indicative.
"<i>If</i> ye love me, ye will keep my
commandments," is resolvable in this manner;
"Give, (give the following fact, or
suppose it) ye love me, ye will keep my
commandments." Or thus, "Ye love me,
give that, ye will keep my commandments."
But on this I shall be more particular when
I come to speak of errors in the use of
verbs.</p>

<p><i>An</i> is still vulgarly used in the sense of
<i>if</i>. "<i>An</i> please your honor," is the usual
address of servants to their masters in England;
tho it is lost in New England. But
a word derived from the same root, is still
retained; viz. the Saxon <i>anan</i>, to give;
which is sometimes pronounced <i>nan</i>, and
sometimes <i>anan</i>. It is used for <i>what</i>, or
<i>what do you say</i>; as when a person speaks
to another, the second person not hearing
distinctly, replies, <i>nan</i>, or <i>anan</i>; that is,
<i>give</i> or <i>repeat</i> what you said. This is ridiculed
as a gross vulgarism; and it is indeed
obsolete except among common people;
but is strictly correct, and if persons
deride the use of the word, it proves
at least that they do not understand its
meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless, <i>lest</i> and <i>else</i>, are all derivatives
of the old Saxon verb <i>lesan</i>, <i>to dismiss</i>, which
we preserve in the word <i>lease</i>, and its compounds.
So far are these words from being
conjunctions, that they are, in fact,
verbs in the Imperative mode; and this
explanation serves further to lay open the
curious structure of our language. For
example:</p>

<p>"Unless ye believe ye shall not understand,"
may be thus resolved; "Ye believe;
<i>dismiss</i> (that fact) ye shall not understand."
Or thus, "<i>Dismiss</i> ye believe, (that circumstance
being away) ye shall not understand."
Thus by analizing the sentence
we find no Subjunctive mode; but merely
the Indicative and Imperative.</p>

<p>"Kiss the Son, lest he be angry," is
resolvable in the same manner: "Kiss the
Son, <i>dismiss</i> (that) he will be angry." <i>Else</i>
is used nearly in the same sense, as in
Chaucer, Freres Tale, 7240:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Axe him thyself, if thou not trowest me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or <i>elles</i> stint a while and thou shalt see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is, "If thou dost not believe me, ask
him thyself, or <i>dismissing</i> (omitting that)
wait and thou shalt be convinced."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Though</i>, or <i>tho</i>, commonly called a conjunction,
is also a verb in the Imperative
Mode. It is from the verb <i>thafian</i> or <i>thafigan</i>,
which, in the Saxon, signified to
<i>grant</i> or <i>allow</i>. The word in its purity is
<i>thaf</i> or <i>thof</i>; and so it is pronounced by
many of the common people in England,
and by some in America.</p>

<p>"<i>Tho</i> he slay me, yet will I trust in
him," may be thus explained; "<i>Allow</i>
(suppose) he should slay me, yet will I trust
in him." That this is the true sense of <i>tho</i>,
is evident from another fact. The old
writers used <i>algife</i> for <i>although</i>; and its
meaning must be nearly the same.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>Since</i> is merely a participle of the old
verb <i>seon</i>, to see. In ancient authors we
find it variously written; as <i>sith</i>, <i>sithence</i>,
<i>sin</i>, <i>sithen</i>, &amp;c. and the common people in
New England still pronounce it <i>sin</i>, <i>sen</i>
or <i>sence</i>. Of all these, <i>sin</i> or <i>sen</i>, which
is so much ridiculed as vulgar, comes nearest
to the original <i>seen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This explanation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>of <i>since</i> unfolds the true theory of languages,
and proves that all words are originally
derived from those which are first
used to express ideas of sensible objects.
Mankind, instead of that abstract sense
which we annex to <i>since</i>, if we have any
idea at all when we use it, originally said,
<i>seen the sun rose, it has become warm</i>; that
is, after the sun rose, or that circumstance
being <i>seen</i> or <i>past</i>. We use the same word
now, with a little variation; but the etymology
is lost to most people, who still employ
the word for a precise purpose, intelligible
to their hearers.</p>

<p><i>But</i> has two distinct meanings, and two
different roots. This is evident to any person
who attends to the manner of using
the word. We say, "<i>But to proceed</i>;" that
is, <i>more</i> or <i>further</i>. We say also, "All
left the room, <i>but</i> one;" that is, except
one. These two significations, which are
constantly and insensibly annexed to the
word, will perhaps explain all its uses; but
cannot be well accounted for, without supposing
it to have two etymologies. Happily
the early writers furnish us with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
means of solving the difficulty. Gawen
Douglass the poet, was cotemporary with
Chaucer, or lived near his time, was Bishop
of Dunkeld in Scotland, and probably
wrote the language in the purity of his
age and country. As the Scots in the
Low Lands, are descendants of the Saxons,
in common with the English, and from
their local situation, have been less exposed
to revolutions, they have preserved more of
the Saxon idiom and orthography than
their southern brethren. In Douglass we
find two different words to express the two
different meanings, which we now annex
to one; viz. <i>bot</i> and <i>but</i>. The first is used
in the sense of <i>more</i>, <i>further</i> or <i>addition</i>;
and the last in the sense of <i>except</i> or <i>take
away</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Bot</i> thy work shall endure in laude and glorie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But</i> spot or falt condigne eterne memorie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first Mr. Horne derives from <i>botan</i>, <i>to
boot, to give more</i>; from which our English
word <i>boot</i>, which is now for the most
part confined to jockeys, is also derived;
and the other from <i>be utan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> <i>to be out
or away</i>. That these etymologies are just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>is probable, both from old writings and
from the present distinct uses of the word
<i>but</i>. This word therefore is the blending
or corruption of <i>bot</i> and <i>beut</i>, the Imperatives
of two Saxon verbs, <i>botan</i> and <i>beutan</i>.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p><i>And</i> is probably a contraction of <i>anan</i>,
to give, the verb before mentioned; and
<i>ad</i>, the root of the verb <i>add</i>, and signifying
<i>series</i> or <i>remainder</i>. <i>An ad, give the remainder.</i></p>

<p>The word <i>with</i>, commonly called a
preposition, is likewise a verb. It is from
the Saxon <i>withan</i>, to join; or more probably
from <i>wyrth</i>, to be, or the German
<i>werden</i>, devenir, to be. The reason for
this latter conjecture, is that we have preserved
the Imperative of <i>wyrth</i> or <i>werden</i>,
in this ancient phrase, "woe <i>worth</i> the
day;" that is, woe be to the day. The
German verb, in its inflections, makes
<i>wirst</i> and <i>wurde</i>; and is undoubtedly from
the same root as the Danish <i>v&aelig;rer</i>, to be.
But whether <i>with</i> has its origin in <i>withan</i>,
to join, or in <i>werden</i>, to be, its sense will
be nearly the same; it will still convey the
idea of connection. This will plainly appear
to any person who considers, that <i>by</i>
is merely a corruption of <i>be</i>, from the old
verb <i>beon</i>; and that this word is still used to
express connection or nearness; "He lives
<i>by</i> me;" "He went <i>by</i> me;" that is, he
lives <i>be</i> me.</p>

<p>This verb <i>be</i> was formerly used in this
phrase; <i>be my faith, be my troth</i>; that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<i>by my faith</i>, as in Chevy Chace.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> We still
find the same verb in a multitude of compounds,
<i>be-come</i>, <i>be-yond</i>, <i>be-tween</i>, <i>be-side</i>,
<i>be-fore</i>. Thus we see what are called <i>prepositions</i>,
are mere combinations or corruptions
of verbs; they are not a primitive
part of language, and if we resolve this
phrase, <i>he went beyond me</i>, we shall find it
composed of these words, <i>he went</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>gone</i>,
<i>me</i>; <i>yond</i> being nothing but the participle
of <i>go</i>.</p>

<p>Will my grammatical readers believe
me, when I assert that the affirmation <i>yea</i>,
or <i>yes</i>, is a verb? That it is so, is undeniable.
The English <i>yea</i>, <i>yes</i>, and the German
<i>ja</i>, pronounced <i>yaw</i>, are derived from
a verb in the Imperative Mode; or rather,
they are but corruptions of <i>aye</i>, the Imperative
of the French <i>avoir</i>, to have. The
pure word <i>aye</i>, is still used in English.
The affirmation <i>yea</i> or <i>yes</i>, is <i>have</i>, an expression
of assent, <i>have what you say</i>.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>That all the words, called <i>adverbs</i>, are
abbreviations or combinations of nouns,
verbs and adjectives, cannot perhaps be
proved; for it is extremely difficult to
trace the little words, <i>when</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>there</i>,
<i>here</i>, &amp;c. to their true origin.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But excepting
a few, the whole class of words,
denominated <i>adverbs</i>, can be resolved into
other parts of speech. The termination
<i>ly</i>, which forms a large proportion of these
words, is derived from the Saxon <i>liche</i>,
<i>like</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And as an angel heaven<i>lich</i> she sung."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Chaucer, Cant. Tales, 1057.<br />
</p>

<p>We have in a few words retained the original
pronunciation, as <i>Godlike</i>; but in
strictness of speech, there is no difference
between <i>Godlike</i> and <i>Godly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding it is evident that
conjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs are
not original and necessary parts of speech,
yet as species of abbreviations, or compound
terms to express assemblages of ideas,
they may be considered as very useful,
and as great improvements in language.
Every person, even without the
least knowlege of etymology, acquires a
habit of annexing a certain idea, or certain
number of ideas to <i>unless</i>, <i>lest</i>, <i>yes</i>, <i>between</i>,
and the other particles; he uses
them with precision, and makes himself
understood by his hearers or readers. These
words enable him to communicate his ideas
with greater facility and expedition,
than he could by mere names and affirmations.
They have lost the distinguishing
characteristics of verbs, person, time, and
inflection. It is therefore convenient for
grammatical purposes, to assign them distinct
places and give them names, according
to their particular uses. Such of these
old verbs as exhibit some connection between
the members of a discourse, may
be properly denominated <i>conjunctions</i>. Others,
that are used to show certain relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
between words and are generally prefixed
to them, may be well called <i>prepositions</i>. A
third species, which are employed to qualify
the sense of other words, may, from
their position and uses in a discourse, be
denominated <i>adverbs</i>. But the foregoing
investigation is necessary to unfold the
true principles on which language is constructed,
and the philosophical enquirer is
referred for a more general view of the
subject, to Mr. Horne Tooke's <i>Diversions
of Purley</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>verb</i> or <i>word</i> is so called by way of
eminence; the ancient grammarians having
considered it as the principal part of
speech. The <i>noun</i> is however entitled to
the precedence; it is of equal importance
in language, and undoubtedly claims priority
of origin. Philosophy might teach
us that the <i>names</i> of a few visible objects
would be first formed by barbarous men,
and afterwards the words which express
the most common actions. But with respect
to names of abstract ideas, as they are
usually called, they not only precede the
formation of the verbs which represent the
action, but it often happens that the same
word is used, with a prefix to denote the
action of the object to which the name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
given. For example, <i>love</i> and <i>fear</i> are the
names of certain passions or affections of
the mind. To express the action or exertion
of these affections, we have not invented
distinct terms; but custom has for
this purpose prefixed the word <i>do</i> or <i>to</i>,
which, in its primitive sense, is <i>to act</i>, <i>move</i>,
or <i>make</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Thus I <i>do love</i>, or <i>do fear</i>, are
merely, I <i>act, love</i>, or <i>act, fear</i>; and <i>to love</i>
and <i>to fear</i> in the Infinitive, are <i>act, love</i>,
and <i>act, fear</i>.</p>

<p>To confirm these remarks, let it be considered
that formerly <i>do</i> and <i>did</i> were almost
invariably used with the verb; as <i>I
do fear</i>, <i>he did love</i>; and the omission of
these words in affirmative declarations is
of a modern date. They are still preserved
in particular modes of expression; as
in the negative and interrogative forms,
and in emphatical assertions.</p>

<p>The present hypothesis will derive additional
strength from another circumstance.
Grammarians allege that the termination
of the regular preterit tense, <i>ed</i>,
is a corruption of <i>did</i>. If so, it seems to
have been originally optional, either to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>place the word <i>did</i>, which expressed the <i>action</i>
of the object, before or after the <i>name</i>.
Thus, <i>he feared</i>, is resolvable into <i>he fear
did</i>, and must be a blending of the words
in a hasty pronunciation. But it was also
a practice to say <i>he did fear</i>, which arrangement
is not yet lost nor obscured; but
in no case are both these forms used, <i>he did
feared</i>; a presumptive evidence of the truth
of the opinion, that <i>ed</i> is a contraction of
<i>did</i>. Indeed I see no objection to the opinion
but this, that it is not easy on this supposition,
to account for the formation of <i>did</i>
from <i>do</i>. If <i>did</i> is itself a contraction of
<i>doed</i>, the regular preterit, which is probable,
whence comes <i>ed</i> in this word? To derive
<i>ed</i> in other words from <i>did</i> is easy and natural;
but this leaves us short of the primary
cause or principle, and consequently
in suspense, as to the truth of the opinion.
Yet whatever may be the true derivation
of the regular ending of the past time and
perfect participle of English verbs, the use
of <i>do</i>, <i>did</i> and <i>to</i> before the verb, is a strong
evidence, that at least one class of affirmations
are formed by the help of <i>names</i>, with
a prefix to denote the action of the objects
expressed by the names. <i>I fear</i>, therefore,
is a phrase, composed of the pronoun <i>I</i>,
and the noun <i>fear</i>; and the affirmation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
contained in the phrase, is derived from
the single circumstance of the position of
the name after <i>I</i>. <i>I fear</i> is a modern substitute
for <i>I do fear</i>; that is, <i>I act, fear</i>;
all originally and strictly <i>nouns</i>. But by a
habit of uniting the personal name <i>I</i> with
the name of the passion <i>fear</i>, we instantly
recognize an affirmation that the passion is
exerted; and <i>do</i>, the primitive name of <i>act</i>,
has become superfluous.</p>


<h3>EXAMINATION <i>of</i> PARTICULAR
PHRASES.</h3>

<p>Having made these few remarks on
the formation of our language, I shall
proceed to examin the criticisms of grammarians
on certain phrases, and endeavor
to settle some points of controversy with
respect to the use of words; and also to
detect some inaccuracies which prevail in
practice.</p>


<h3>NOUNS.</h3>

<p>Writers upon the subject of propriety
in our language, have objected to the
use of <i>means</i>, with the article <i>a</i> and the definitive
pronouns singular, <i>this</i> and <i>that</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
The objection made is, that as this word
ends in <i>s</i>, it must be plural, and cannot be
joined in construction with words in the
singular. This objection supposes that all
nouns ending with <i>s</i> are plural; but this
would perhaps prove too much, and make
it necessary to consider all nouns, <i>not</i> ending
in <i>s</i>, as singular, which cannot be true,
even on the principles of those who bring
the objection. The supposition in both
cases would be equally well founded.</p>

<p>It appears to me however, that the sense
of the word, and particularly the universal
practice of the English nation, ought to
have induced the critical grammarian, who
wished to reduce the language to some certainty,
to suppress the objection. The
word <i>means</i>, applied to a single instrument
of action, or cause, conveys a <i>single</i> idea;
and I presume, was generally used for this
purpose, till Bishop Lowth questioned the
propriety of the practice; at least <i>mean</i> is
scarcely used as a noun, in any author
from Chaucer to Lowth. On the contrary,
the best writers have used <i>means</i> either
in the singular or plural number, according
as they had occasion to express by it
an idea of one cause or more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"By <i>this means</i>, it became every man's
interest, as well as his duty to prevent all
crimes."&mdash;&mdash;Temple, Works, vol. 3. p. 133.</p>

<p>"And by <i>this means</i> I should not doubt,"
&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Wilkins Real Character, book 1.</p>

<p>"And finding themselves by <i>this means</i>
to be safe."&mdash;&mdash;Sidney on Gov. chap. 3.
sect. 36.</p>

<p>"For he hopeth by <i>this means</i> to acquit
himself."&mdash;&mdash;Rawley's Sylva Sylvarum.</p>

<p>"And by <i>that means</i> they lost their barrier."&mdash;&mdash;Moyle
on the Lacedem. Gov.</p>

<p>"Clodius was now qu&aelig;stor and by <i>that
means</i> a senator."&mdash;&mdash;Middleton L. of Cic.
vol. 1. p. 261.</p>

<p>"By <i>this means</i> however, there was nothing
left to the Parliament of Ireland."&mdash;&mdash;Blackstone's
Com. vol. 1. p. 102.</p>

<p>In this manner was the word used by
the elegant writers in Queen Anne's reign.</p>

<p>But we have not only the authority of
almost every good writer in the language,
for this use of <i>means</i> in the singular as
well as plural number, but we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
authority of almost unanimous national
practice in speaking. It is rare to hear
<i>mean</i> used as a noun, and by those only
who are fettered by the arbitrary rules of
grammarians. I question whether the
word, in the singular form, has obtained
such an establishment, as to be entitled to
a place among the English nouns. The
use of it appears like pedantry. No man,
whatever may be his rank and abilities, has
a right to reject a mode of speech, established
by immemorial usage and universal
consent. Grammars should be formed on
<i>practice</i>; for practice determines what a
language is. I do not mean a <i>local</i> practice,
for this would subject us to perpetual variety
and instability; but <i>national</i> or <i>general</i>
practice. The latter, it has been remarked,
is the standard of propriety, to which
all local idioms and private opinions should
be sacrificed. The business of a grammarian
is not to examin whether or not national
practice is founded on philosophical
principles; but to <i>ascertain</i> the national
practice, that the learner may be able
to weed from his own any local peculiarities
or false idioms.</p>

<p>If <i>this means</i> and <i>a means</i> are now, and
have immemorially been, used by good au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>thors
and the nation in general, neither
Johnson, Lowth, nor any other person,
however learned, has a right to say that
the phrases are not <i>good English</i>. That
this is the fact, every person may satisfy
himself, by consulting the good authors
and observing the universal practice in discourse.</p>

<p>Besides, the general practice of a nation
is not easily changed, and the only effect
that an attempt to reform it can produce,
is, to make <i>many</i> people doubtful,
cautious, and consequently uneasy; to
render a <i>few</i> ridiculous and pedantic by
following nice criticisms in the face of customary
propriety; and to introduce a distinction
between the learned and unlearned,
which serves only to create difficulties
for both.</p>

<p>Dr. Priestley is the only writer upon
this subject who seems to have been guided
by just principles. He observes, with great
propriety, that "Grammarians have leaned
too much to the analogies of the Latin
language, contrary to our mode of speaking
and to the analogies of other languages,
more like our own. It must be allowed,
that the custom of speaking, is the origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>al
and only just standard of any language."
Pref. to Gram. page 9. His criticisms are
exceedingly judicious, and are entitled to
the consideration of the student, in preference
to those of Lowth, or any other English
author. He considers <i>means</i> as belonging
"to that class of words which do not
change their termination on account of
number." It is used in both numbers, <i>a
means</i>, or <i>these means</i>, with equal propriety.</p>

<p>To the same class of words belong <i>pains</i>,
<i>news</i>, and perhaps some others. Every
person who has read good English authors,
or lived where the language is spoken in
purity, must have observed that the word
<i>pains</i> is usually preceded by <i>much</i>, and followed
by a verb in the singular number;
<i>much pains was taken</i>. If the word is a
plural noun, it should neither be followed
by a singular verb, nor preceded by <i>much</i>;
for we never prefix <i>much</i> to plurals. The
most untutored ear would be offended at
<i>much papers</i>, <i>much labors</i>. But do we not
always say <i>much pains</i>? Do we ever say
<i>many pains were</i> taken? I confess I never
yet heard or saw the expression. Yet
Lowth contends that <i>pains</i> is plural. This
criticism upon the word is an authority in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
vindication of an erroneous practice of
using it with a plural verb, even when it
is preceded by <i>much</i>. So in Sheridan's Art
of Reading, we observe these words; "If
so <i>much pains were</i> thought necessary among
them," &amp;c. Temple indulges the same
mistake; "I know how <i>much pains have
been</i> taken to deduce the words <i>Baro</i> and
<i>feudum</i> from the Latin and Greek, and even
from the Hebrew and Egyptian tongue."
Works, vol. 3. p. 365.</p>

<p>Might not these writers have used,
<i>much sheep were killed</i>, with the same propriety?</p>

<p>The sense of the word <i>pains</i> does not
require that we should consider it as a plural;
for it signifies <i>labor</i> or <i>fatigue</i>, in contradistinction
to those uneasy sensations,
each of which singly is called a <i>pain</i>, and
to express a number of which <i>pains</i> is used
as a plural. On the other hand we have
the authority of general practice for uniting
with it <i>much</i>, which can in no case be
used with a plural, and also a verb in the
singular number.</p>

<p>&mdash;"And taken <i>much pains</i> so to proportion
the powers of the several magistrates."&mdash;&mdash;Sidney
on Gov. sect. I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"I found <i>much art</i> and <i>pains</i> employed."&mdash;&mdash;Middleton.</p>

<p>"He will assemble materials with <i>much
pains</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Bolling. on Hist. letter 4.</p>

<p>"As to our own language, several persons
have taken <i>much pains</i> about the orthography
of it."&mdash;&mdash;Wilkins Real Char.
book I. chap. 5.</p>

<p>There are a few instances in which
good authors have considered <i>news</i> as a
plural; as</p>

<p>"From all regions where the best <i>news
are</i> made."&mdash;&mdash;B. Johnson, Staple of News.</p>

<p>"And seal the news and issue <i>them</i>."&mdash;&mdash;The
same.</p>

<p>But can an English ear relish this affected
correctness? Hear the language of
Cowley and Shakespear, who wrote as the
nation spoke:</p>

<span class="i0">"A <span class="smcap">general</span> joy at <i>this glad newes</i> appear'd."<br /></span>

man would expose himself to ridicule, who
should say, <i>these news are good</i>.</p>

<p>Late writers seem to consider <i>riches</i> as
plural; but erroneously. It is merely a
contraction of <i>richesse</i>, the French singular,
which was probably introduced into
England under the Norman kings. Chaucer
uses <i>richesse</i> as the singular:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But for ye speken of swiche gentillesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As is descended out of old <i>richesse</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cant. Tales, 6691.<br />
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"And he that ones to love doeth his homage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oftentymes dere bought <i>is the richesse</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
La Belle Dame sans mercy, 323.<br />
</p>

<p>The word <i>richesse</i> here is no more plural
than <i>gentilnesse</i>, <i>distresse</i>, <i>doublenesse</i>, which
the author uses in the same poem; and
<i>riches</i> now, in strictness of speech, is no
more plural than <i>gentleness</i>, <i>distress</i>, or any
other word of similar ending. When
Chaucer had occasion for a plural, he wrote
the word <i>richesses</i>; as in the Tale of Melibeus:
"Thou hast dronke so muche hony
of swete temporal <i>richesses</i> and delices and
honors of this world," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Works, vol.
4. p. 170. Bell's edit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The word <i>riches</i> therefore is in the singular
number and merely an abbreviation
of <i>richesse</i>; as <i>distress</i> is of <i>distresse</i>; <i>weakness</i>,
of <i>weaknesse</i>, &amp;c. and the reason why
the plural <i>richesses</i> has been neglected, may
be, that the idea it conveys does not admit
of number any more than that of <i>wealth</i>,
which is also destitute of a plural form.</p>

<p>"Was ever <i>riches</i> gotten by your golden
mediocrities?"&mdash;&mdash;Cowley on Cromwell's
Gov.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When love has taken all thou hast away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength by too much riches will decay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cowley.<br />
</p>

<p>"The envy and jealousy which great
<i>riches</i> is always attended with."&mdash;&mdash;Moyle's
Essay on Lacedem. Gov. 48.</p>

<p>"In one hour <i>is</i> so great <i>riches</i> come to
nought."&mdash;&mdash;Bible.</p>

<p>Here <i>riches</i> is considered in its true
light. Notwithstanding this, the termination
of the word has led late writers
into the opinion, that it is plural; so that
we generally see it followed by a plural
verb: Should this become the unanimous
opinion and a general correspondent practice
ensue, <i>riches</i> will be established as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
plural, contrary to etymology and ancient
usage.</p>

<p><i>Alms</i> is also in the singular number;
being a contraction of the old Norman
French, <i>almesse</i>, the plural of which was
<i>almesses</i>. So in Chaucer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ye knowen wel that I am poure and olde,
Kithe (show) your <i>almesse</i> upon me poure wretche."</p>

<p>Freres Tale, 7190.</p></div>

<p>"<i>This almesse</i> shouldest thou do of thy
propre thinges," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Vol. 5. p. 217.
Bell.</p>

<p>"These ben generally the <i>almesses</i> and
werkes of charitie of hem that have temporel
richesses."&mdash;&mdash;The same.</p>

<p><i>Alms</i> is used as a noun singular in the
Bible; "To ask <i>an alms</i>." "He gave
<i>much alms</i>;" that is, <i>almesse</i>, or charity.
The plural of this word is not used.</p>

<p><i>Largess</i> is a word of this class. It is
from the old French <i>largesse</i>; but the idea
admits of number, and accordingly we find
the plural, <i>largesses</i>, still in use.</p>

<p><i>Laches</i>, from the French <i>lachesse</i>, is still
retained in the law stile; but custom has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
abbreviated the word into <i>lache</i>, a single
syllable.</p>

<p><i>Amends</i> may properly be considered as
in the singular number, and so it is used
by one of our best writers. "They must
needs think that this honor to him, when
dead, was but <i>a</i> necessary <i>amends</i> for the injury
which they had done him, when living."&mdash;&mdash;Middleton's
L. of Cic. vol. 3. p. 131.</p>

<p>The idea here conveyed by <i>amends</i> is as
single as that expressed by <i>compensation</i>.
The word has no change of termination,
and may be considered as singular or plural,
at the choice of the writer.</p>

<p><i>Wages</i> is a word of the same kind.</p>

<p><i>Victuals</i> is derived from the old French
<i>vitaille</i>,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and was formerly used in the singular
form, <i>victual</i>. But the latter is now
wholly disused, and <i>victuals</i> generally used
with a singular verb and pronoun. So
Swift uses the word. "We had such very
fine <i>victuals</i> that I could not eat <i>it</i>."<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>editor of his works remarks, <i>that here is
false concord</i>; but I believe Swift has followed
the general practice of the English.
The word seems to have lost the plurality
of ideas, annexed to many different articles
included in the term, and to have assumed
the general meaning of the word <i>food</i>, which
does not admit of the plural.</p>

<p>The word <i>odds</i> seems to be of the same
kind. We sometimes find a plural verb
united to it, as in Pope's translation of
Homer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On valor's side the <i>odds</i> of combat <i>lie</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brave live glorious, or lamented die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Iliad, b. 15. l. 670.<br />
</p>

<p>But in common practice <i>odds</i> is considered
as in the singular number. We always
say, "What <i>is</i> the <i>odds</i>;" and I should
rank this among the words, which, altho
they have the termination of regular plurals,
more properly belong to the singular
number.</p>

<p>The word <i>gallows</i> is evidently of this
class. "Let <i>a gallows</i> be made," say the
translators of the Bible, with perfect propriety.
Indeed I cannot conceive how any
man who has read English authors, can
consider this word as in the plural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bellows</i>, <i>tongs</i>, <i>sheers</i>, <i>scissors</i>, <i>snuffers</i>,
<i>pincers</i>, have no change of termination, and
it is the practice to prefix to them the
word <i>pair</i>. Yet notwithstanding these articles
are composed of two principal parts,
both are necessary to form a single indivisible
instrument, and the names might have
been considered as nouns in the singular.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
<i>Pair</i> is more properly applied to two separate
articles of the same kind, and used
together; a <i>pair of shoes</i>, or <i>gloves</i>. Custom,
however, has sanctioned the use of it
before the words just enumerated, and
therefore a pair of tongs, &amp;c. must be admitted
as good English.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>There are many other words in our
language which have the plural termination;
as <i>billiards</i>, <i>ethics</i>, <i>metaphysics</i>, <i>mathematics</i>,
<i>measles</i>, <i>hysterics</i>, and many others;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>which properly belong to the singular
number. <i>Ethics is a science</i>, is better English
than <i>ethics are</i>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many
words, which, without ever taking the plural
termination, often belong to the plural.
<i>Sheep</i>, <i>deer</i> and <i>hose</i>, are often mentioned as
belonging to this description. To these
we may add many names of fish; as <i>trout</i>,
<i>salmon</i>, <i>carp</i>, <i>tench</i> and others, which are in
fact names of species; but which apply equally
to the individuals of the species.
We say <i>a trout</i>, or <i>five trout</i>; but never <i>five
trouts</i>.</p>


<h3>POSSESSIVE CASE.</h3>

<p>In many instances we find two or three
words used to describe or designate a particular
person or thing; in which case they
are to be considered as a single noun or
name, and the sign of the possessive annexed
to the last; as, "the <i>King of France's</i>
army."</p>

<p>"<i>Fletcher of Salton's plan</i> of a militia differs
little from that of Harrington."<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;&mdash; Home,
Sketch 9.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<h3>ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>Most grammarians have given the article
the first rank among the parts of
speech. To me this arrangement appears
very incorrect; for the article is a mere
appendage of the noun, and without it
cannot even be defined. The <i>noun</i> is the
primary and principal part of speech, of
which the <i>article</i>, <i>pronoun</i> and <i>adjective</i> are
mere adjuncts, attendants, or substitutes,
and the latter therefore should follow the
former in grammatical order and definition.</p>

<p>Under this head I will introduce a few
observations on the use of <i>a</i>. Grammarians
have supposed that <i>a</i>, in the phrases <i>a
going</i>, <i>a hunting</i>, is a corruption of the preposition
<i>on</i>; a supposition, which, if we attend
to the sense of the phrases, appears
highly absurd, but which etymology, in a
great measure, overthrows.</p>

<p>In the first place, the preposition is not
among the original parts of language; its
use, and consequently its formation, are not
necessary among rude nations; it is a part
of speech of a late date in the progress of
language, and is itself a derivative from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
other words. I have, in another place,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
given some reasons to prove <i>on</i> to be an
abbreviation of the numeral <i>one</i>, or <i>top one</i>.
It is very evident that <i>on</i> is a contraction
of <i>upon</i>, which was formerly written <i>uppone</i>;
and there are good reasons for believing
the latter to be derived from <i>top one</i>.
In addition to the authorities quoted in
the Institute, an example or two from
Chaucer will almost place the question beyond
a doubt.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There lith on&mdash;up myn hed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cant. Tales, 4288.<br />
</p>

<p>That is, there lieth one upon my head;
where <i>up</i> is used for <i>upon</i>, as it is in other
places.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No more, <i>up paine</i> of losing of your hed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Ibm. 1709.<br />
</p>

<p>That is, <i>upon pain of losing your head</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>up</i> is undoubtedly but a corruption
of <i>top</i>, or a noun derived from the
same root, and this hypothesis is supported
by the true theory of language; which
is, that rude nations converse mostly by
names. <i>Up myn hed</i>, is <i>top mine head</i>. An
improvement of this phrase would be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>use of <i>one</i>, <i>ane</i> or <i>an</i>, to ascertain particular
things; <i>uppone</i>, <i>upon</i>. In the progress
of language, these words would be contracted
into <i>on</i>, which we denominate a
preposition.</p>

<p>I am very sensible that Chaucer used <i>on</i>
in the manner mentioned by Lowth;
<i>on live</i> for <i>alive</i>; <i>on hunting</i>; <i>on hawking</i>;
which would seem to warrant the supposition
of that writer, that <i>a</i> is a contraction
of <i>on</i>, considering <i>on</i> originally as a preposition.
But it is contrary to all just ideas
of language to allow such a primitive part
of speech. On the other hand, Chaucer
uses <i>on</i> for other purposes, which cannot
be explained on Lowth's hypothesis.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His brede, his ale, was alway <i>after on</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cant. Tales, 343.<br />
</p>

<p>So also in line 1783. In this example
<i>on</i> is allowed on all hands to be a contraction
of <i>one</i>; <i>after one</i> (way, manner) that
is, <i>alike</i>, or in the same manner.</p>

<p>"They were <i>at on</i>;" line 4195. They
were <i>at one</i>; that is, together or agreed.</p>

<p>"Ever <i>in on</i>;" line 1773, and 3878;
ever <i>in one</i> (way, course, &amp;c.) that is, <i>continually</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>If therefore we suppose <i>on</i> to be merely
a corruption of <i>one</i>, we can easily explain
all its uses. <i>On hunting</i>, or contractedly,
<i>a hunting</i>, is <i>one hunting</i>. <i>On live</i>, <i>on life</i>,
or <i>alive</i>, is merely <i>one life</i>. This form of
expression is very natural, however childish
or improper it may appear to us. It
seems very obvious to resolve <i>ashore</i>, <i>abed</i>,
into <i>on shore</i>, <i>on bed</i>; but even Lowth himself
would be puzzled to make us believe
that <i>adry</i>, <i>athirst</i>, came from <i>on dry</i>, <i>on
thirst</i>; and Wallis would find equal difficulty
to convince us that they came from <i>at dry</i>, <i>at
thirst</i>. If we suppose <i>a</i> to be a contraction
of <i>one</i>, or the Saxon <i>ane</i> or <i>an</i>, the solution
of all these phrases is perfectly easy, and
corresponds with Horne's theory of the
particles. For if rude nations converse
without particles, they must say <i>go shore</i>,
or <i>go one shore</i>; <i>he is bed</i>, or <i>he is one bed</i>;
<i>he is dry</i>, or <i>one dry</i>; <i>I am thirst</i>, or <i>I am one
thirst</i>. Indeed every person who will attend
to the manner of speaking among the
American savages, must believe this explanation
of the phrases to be probably just.</p>

<p>That <i>on</i> was formerly used both as a
preposition and an adjective, is acknowleged
by the Editor of the British Poets;<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>but its uses in all cases may be easily explained
on the single principle before mentioned.</p>

<p>This hypothesis however will be confirmed
by the fact, that the English article
<i>a</i>, "is nothing more than a corruption of
the Saxon adjective, <i>ane</i> or <i>an</i> (one) before
a substantive beginning with a consonant."
Editor of Chaucer's works, Gloss. p. 23.
And the article <i>a</i> and the numeral <i>one</i> have
still the same signification. That <i>ane</i> or
<i>an</i>, and <i>one</i> are originally the same, is a
point not to be controverted. We have
therefore the strongest reason to believe that
<i>a</i> in the phrases <i>a going</i>, <i>a hunting</i>, <i>a fishing</i>
is derived from <i>one</i>. <i>On</i>, as a contraction
of <i>upon</i>, has, in modern language, a different
sense, and cannot be well substituted
for <i>a</i>; for <i>on going</i>, <i>on fishing</i>, have an awkward
appearance and will not obtain in
the language, to the exclusion of <i>a going</i>,
<i>a fishing</i>. The vulgar practice is more
correct than Lowth's correction, and ought
by no means to be rejected.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O let my life, if thou so many deaths <i>a coming</i> find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thine old year its voyage take."&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cowley's Ode to the New Year.<br />
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To be as long <i>a dying</i> as Methusalem."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Cowley.<br />
</p>

<p>If the foregoing opinion of the origin
of <i>a</i> in such phrases, should not be deemed
satisfactory, we may perhaps ascribe its origin
to a mere custom of forming expletive
sounds in the transition from one word to
another.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The following phrases, <i>three shillings a
piece</i>, <i>a day</i>, <i>a head</i>, <i>a bushel</i>, it is said are
elliptical forms of speech; some preposition
being implied, as, <i>for</i> or <i>by</i>. This
assertion can proceed only from an imperfect
view of the subject. Unless grammarians
can prove that some preposition was
formerly used, which is now omitted, they
cannot prove that any is implied, nor
should they have recourse to implication to
find a rule to parse the phrases. The truth
is, no such preposition can be found, nor
is there need of any. <i>A</i>, in this form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>speech, carries the full meaning of the Latin
<i>per</i>, and the substitution of the latter,
for want, as it is said, of an English word,
in the phrases, <i>per day</i>, <i>per head</i>, <i>per pound</i>,
is a burlesque upon the English to this
day. We see continually a wretched jargon
of Latin and English in every merchant's
book, even to the exclusion of a
pure English phrase, more concise, more
correct, and more elegant. It is to be
wished that <i>a</i> might be restored to its true
dignity, as it is used by some of the purest
English writers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To the sixteen scholars twenty pounds
<i>a piece</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Cowley.</p></div>

<p>This is pure elegant English, and the
common people have the honor of preserving
it, unadulterated by foreign words.</p>


<h3><em class="gesperrt">VERB.</em></h3>

<p>The most difficult branch of this subject
is the verb. Next to the noun, this
is the most important part of speech, and
as it includes all the terms by which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
express action and existence, in their numberless
varieties, it must, in all languages,
be very comprehensive.</p>

<p>The English verb suffers very few inflections
or changes of termination, to express
the different circumstances of person,
number, time and mode. Its inflections
are confined to the three persons of the
singular number, in the present tense, indicative
mode, and the first and second persons
of the past tense; unless we consider
the irregular participles as a species of inflection
belonging to the verb. All the
other varieties of person, number, time and
mode, are expressed by prefixing other
words, by various combinations of words,
or by a particular manner of utterance.</p>

<p>This simplicity, as it is erroneously called,
is said to render our language easy of
acquisition. The reverse however of this
is true; for the use of auxiliaries or combinations
of words, constitutes the most
perplexing branch of grammar; it being
much easier to learn to change the termination
of the verb, than to combine
two, three or four words for the same
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Grammarians have usually divided the
English verbs into <i>active</i>, <i>passive</i> and <i>neuter</i>.
"<i>Active</i> verbs," say they,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> "express
action, and necessarily imply an agent and
an object acted upon." But is not a man
<i>passive</i> in <i>hearing</i>? Yet <i>hear</i> is called an
<i>active</i> verb.</p>

<p>"A verb <i>neuter</i> expresses being, or a
state or condition of being; when the agent
and object coincide, and the event is
properly neither action nor passion, but
rather something between both." But is
there neither <i>action</i> nor <i>passion</i> in <i>walking</i>,
<i>running</i>, <i>existing</i>? One would think that
<i>running</i> at least might be called <i>action</i>.</p>

<p>The common definitions, copied, in
some measure, from the Latin Grammars,
are very inaccurate. The most correct
and general division of English verbs, is,
into <i>transitive</i> and <i>intransitive</i>; the former
term comprehending all verbs that may be
followed by any object receiving the action,
or of which any thing is affirmed;
the latter, all those verbs, the affirmation
in which is limited to the agent. Thus
<i>hear</i> is a <i>transitive</i> verb, for it affirms
something of an object; <i>I hear the bell</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Run</i> is an <i>intransitive</i> verb, for the action
mentioned is confined to the agent; <i>he
runs</i>. Yet the last is an <i>active</i> verb, and
the first, strictly speaking, is not;<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> so that
there is a distinction to be made between a
verb <i>active</i> and <i>transitive</i>.</p>

<p>In strict propriety, we have in English
no passive verb; that is, we have no single
word which conveys the idea of passion or
suffering, in the manner of the Greek or
Latin passive verb. It may be useful, in
teaching English to youth or foreigners, to
exhibit a specimen of the combinations of
the verb <i>be</i>, with the participles of other
verbs in all their varieties; but each word
should be parsed as a distinct part of speech;
altho two or more may be necessary to convey
an idea which is expressed by a single
word in another language.</p>


<h3>TIME.</h3>

<p>Time is naturally divided into <i>past</i>,
<i>present</i> and <i>future</i>. The English verb has
but two variations of ending to express
time; the present, as <i>love</i>, <i>write</i>; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>past, as <i>loved</i>, <i>wrote</i>. The usual division
of tenses, or combinations of words corresponding
to the Latin tenses, is not wholly
accurate. The definition of the second
tense, in the ordinary arrangement of them
in Latin grammars, may be correct, as it
relates to the Roman tongue; but does not
apply to the English tense, which is commonly
called by the same name, the <i>Imperfect</i>.
The Latin words <i>movebam</i>, <i>legebam</i>,
are translated <i>I moved</i>, <i>I read</i>. Now
the English words express actions <i>perfectly
past</i>, and therefore the time or tense cannot be
justly denominated <i>imperfect</i>. If the Latin
words expressed, in the Roman tongue, actions
<i>imperfectly past</i>, they should be rendered
by us, <i>I was moving</i>, <i>was reading</i>,
which convey ideas of actions, as taking
place at some preceding period, but not
then past. In this sense, the name of the
tense might have been used with propriety.
But the English form of expression, <i>he
moved</i>, conveys the idea of an action completely
past, and does not fall within the
definition of the Latin <i>Imperfect</i>.</p>

<p>It is surprizing that the great Lowth
should rank this form of the verb, <i>they
moved</i>, under the head of <i>indefinite</i> or <i>undetermined</i>
time; and yet place this form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<i>have moved</i>, or what is called the perfect
tense, under the head of <i>definite</i> or <i>determined</i>
time. The truth is, the first is the
most <i>definite</i>. <i>I have loved</i>, or <i>moved</i>, expresses
an action performed and completed,
generally within a period of time not
far distant; but leaves the particular point
of time wholly <i>indefinite</i> or <i>undetermined</i>.
On the other hand, <i>I loved</i> is necessarily
employed, when a particular <i>period</i> or <i>point</i>
of time is specified. Thus it is correct to
say, <i>I read a book yesterday</i>, <i>last week</i>, <i>ten
years ago</i>, &amp;c. but it is not grammatical to
say, <i>I have read a book yesterday</i>, <i>last week</i>,
&amp;c. so that, directly contrary to Lowth's
rule, <i>I moved</i>, is the <i>definite</i>, and <i>I have moved</i>,
the <i>indefinite</i> time.</p>

<p>Great inaccuracy is likewise indulged
in the usual description of the English future
tense. There is no variation of the
verb to express a future action; to remedy
this defect, the English use <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>,
before the verb in its radical form. But
these words are both in the present time;
being merely the Teutonic verbs <i>sollen</i> and
<i>wollen</i>, which formerly had, and in the
German still have, most of the inflections
of regular verbs. Thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ind. Pref. <i>Ich soll</i>, I ought or should. <i>Ich
will</i>, I will.</p>

<p>Imp. <i>Ich sollt</i>, I ought or should. <i>Ich wollt</i>,
I would.</p>

<p>Preter. <i>Ich habe gesollt</i>, I ought or should
have. <i>Ich habe gewollt</i>, I would or
would have, &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p></div>

<p><i>I will go</i> is really nothing more than a
<i>present</i> promise of a <i>future</i> action. I <i>shall
go</i> is a <i>present</i> prediction of a <i>future</i> action.
In the second and third persons, <i>will</i> expresses
the prediction; and as one cannot
promise for a second or third person, <i>shall</i>,
in these persons, implies a promise of the
first person, that he will <i>command</i> or <i>oblige</i>
the second or third person to do an action
in some future time. The whole may be
thus explained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I will go</i>,</p></div>

<p>Is my own <i>present</i> promise to do a future
action.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Thou wilt go</i>&mdash;<i>He will go</i>,</p></div>

<p>are my (the speaker's) <i>present</i> predictions
that the persons mentioned will do a future
action; or perhaps more properly, a
declaration of their inclination or intention.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>I shall go</i>,</p></div>

<p>is my <i>present</i> prediction of a future action.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Thou shalt go</i>&mdash;<i>He shall go</i>,</p></div>

<p>are my (the speaker's) <i>present</i> promise that
the second and third persons will do a future
action. But as a man cannot compel
a superior, he can promise only for himself
or inferiors; therefore these last expressions
imply a promise in the speaker,
and a right to command the second and
third persons to do the thing promised; for
which reason they are used only in addressing
or speaking of, inferiors or subjects.
The same remarks apply to the three persons
in the plural number.</p>

<p>Hence we observe the inaccuracy of
translating the future tense of the Greeks,
Romans, and French, by <i>shall</i> or <i>will</i> indifferently.
It is probable that the future
tense in those languages, and perhaps in
others, where the tense is formed by inflections,
was employed merely to <i>foretell</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
If so, <i>shall</i> only should be used in the first
person of the English translation, and
<i>will</i>, in the second and third. Thus:</p>



<div class="tdl">
<table cellpadding="4" summary="table">
<tr><th class="tdc"><i>Latin.</i></th><th class="tdc"><i>French.</i></th><th class="tdc"><i>English.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td>Habebo,</td><td>J'aurai,</td><td>I shall have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Habebimus,</td><td>nous aurons,</td><td>we shall have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Habebis,</td><td>tu auras,</td><td>thou wilt have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Habebit,</td><td>il aura,</td><td>he will have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Habebitis,</td><td>vous aurez,</td><td>you will have.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Habebunt,</td><td>ils auront,</td><td>they will have.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>On the other hand, a promise in the first
person expressed in English by <i>will</i>, and a
promise or command in the second and
third, expressed by <i>shall</i>, seem, in these languages,
to be communicated by other words
or a circumlocution.</p>

<p>In strictness of speech therefore, we have
no future tense of the verb in English;
but we use auxiliaries, which, in the present
tense, express a prediction of an action,
or a disposition of mind to produce an action.
These auxiliaries, united with the
verb or affirmation, answer the purposes of
the future tenses of verbs in other languages;
and no inconvenience can arise
from calling such a combination a <i>tense</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>


<h3>MODE.</h3>

<p>Most languages are so constructed,
that the verbs change their terminations
for the purpose of expressing the <i>manner</i> of
being or action. In this particular, the
English is singular; there being but one
inflection of a single verb, which can be
said to be peculiar to the conditional or
subjunctive mode.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In all other respects,
the verbs in the declaratory and conditional
modes are the same; and the condition
is known only by some other word prefixed
to the verb.</p>

<p>It is astonishing to see how long and
how stupidly English grammarians have
followed the Latin grammars in their divisions
of time and mode; but in particular
the latter. By this means, we often find
<i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>should</i> and <i>must</i> in a conditional
mode, when they are positive declarations
and belong to the indicative. All unconditional
declarations, whether of an action,
or of a <i>right</i>, <i>power</i> or <i>necessity</i> of doing an
action, belong to the <i>indicative</i>; and the
distinction between the <i>indicative</i> and <i>potential</i>
is totally useless. <i>Should</i> is commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>placed in the imperfect time of the
subjunctive; yet is frequently used to express
an unconditional obligation, as <i>he
should go</i>; and belongs to the present time
of the indicative, as much as <i>he ought</i>, or
the French <i>il faut</i> or <i>il doit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Would</i> is sometimes employed in a declaratory
sense to express a present volition,
and then belongs to the indicative. In the
past time, <i>should</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>could</i>, often
express unconditional ideas, and belong to
the indicative. In short, the usual arrangement
of the English verbs and auxiliaries
in our grammars is calculated to perplex
and mislead a learner; and I have
never found a foreigner who could use
them with tolerable propriety.</p>


<h3>NUMBER <i>and</i> PERSON.</h3>

<p>Under this head, I shall remark on a
single article only, the use of <i>you</i> in the
singular number, with a plural verb. The
use of the plural <i>nos</i> and <i>vos</i>, for <i>ego</i> and <i>tu</i>
in Latin; of <i>nous</i> and <i>vous</i> for <i>je</i> and <i>tu</i> in
French; seems to have been very ancient,
and to have been originally intended to
soften the harshness of egotism, or to make
a respectful distinction in favor of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
personages. But the practice became general
in the French nation, was introduced
by them into England, and gradually imitated
by the English in their own tongue.
<i>You</i>, in familiar discourse, is applied to an
individual, except by a single sect of Christians;
the practice is general and of long
standing; it has become correct English,
and ought to be considered, in grammar,
as a pronoun in the singular number. It
may be objected, that we unite with it a
verb in the plural number, <i>you are</i>, <i>you
have</i>; this is true, but the verb, in these instances,
becomes singular; and both the
pronoun and verb should be placed in the
singular number.</p>

<p>In the union of <i>you</i> with a plural verb
in the present time, we are all unanimous;
but in the past time, there is a difference
between books and common practice in a
single instance. In books, <i>you</i> is commonly
used with the plural of the verb <i>be</i>, <i>you
were</i>; in conversation, it is generally followed
by the singular, <i>you was</i>. Notwithstanding
the criticisms of grammarians,
the antiquity and universality of this practice
must give it the sanction of propriety;
for what but practice forms a language?
This practice is not merely vulgar; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
general among men of erudition who do
not affect to be fettered by the rules of
grammarians, and some late writers have
indulged it in their publications. I should
therefore inflect the verb <i>be</i> in the past time
after this manner; <i>I was</i>, <i>thou wast</i>, or <i>you
was</i>, <i>he was</i>, &amp;c. Whatever objections
may be raised to this inflection, <i>it is the
language of the English</i>, and rules can hardly
change a general practice of speaking;
nor would there be any advantage in the
change, if it could be effected.</p>


<h3>AUXILIARIES.</h3>

<p>There are several verbs in English,
which, from the necessity of their union with
other verbs, have obtained the name of
<i>auxiliaries</i>. Originally they were principal
verbs, with regular Saxon infinitives, and
the usual inflections; as may be observed by
any person, who has the smallest acquaintance
with the modern German, which retains
more of the ancient structure, than
any other branch of the primitive language.</p>

<p>The verbs, called <i>auxiliaries</i> or <i>helpers</i>,
are <i>do</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>may</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>must</i>.
The three first are often employed alone,
and are therefore acknowleged to be sometimes
principal verbs. That the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
were so, will be made obvious by a specimen
from the German, with the corresponding
English.</p>



<div class="tdl">
<table cellpadding="4" summary="table">
<tr><th></th><th class="tdc"><i>German.</i></th><th class="tdc"><i>English.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td>Inf.</td><td><i>Wollen</i>,</td><td>to will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ind. Pref.</td><td>Ich will,</td><td>I will.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Wir wollen,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></td><td>we will.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Imper.</td><td>Ich wolte,</td><td>I would.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Part.</td><td>Wollend,</td><td>willing.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><i>Sollen</i>, to shall, is inflected in the same
manner. <i>Koennen</i>, to can, or be able, is
inflected much in the same manner. <i>Ich
kann</i>, I can, &amp;c. Imperfect, <i>Ich konnte</i>, I
could. Preterit, <i>Ich habe gehonnt</i>, I have
could (or been able.) Participle, <i>K&aelig;nnend</i>,
<i>canning</i>, being able. Thus <i>m&aelig;gen</i>, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>may, makes, in the past tenses, <i>Ich mochte</i>,
I might or mought, as the vulgar sometimes
pronounce it; <i>Ich habe gemocht</i>, <i>I
have might</i>. <i>Must</i> also, which in English
has lost all inflection, is varied in the German;
<i>mussen</i>, to must, or be obliged; Imperfect,
<i>Ich muste</i>, I must, or was obliged.</p>

<p>But whatever these verbs may have once
been, yet from their loss of several inflections
and the participles, with their singular
use in combination with other verbs,
they may very well be denominated <i>auxiliary
verbs</i>. Their true force in English
should be ascertained and explained in
grammars for the benefit of learners, and
particularly for the assistance of foreigners;<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
yet in resolving sentences, each should
be considered as a verb or distinct part of
speech.</p>

<p>For want of a clear and accurate knowlege
of the English auxiliaries, foreigners
are apt to fall into material errors in constructing
sentences. The most numerous
errors appear in the use of <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i>,
and their inflections. The Scots and Irish,
even of the first rank, generally use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><i>will</i> for <i>shall</i> in the first person; by which
means, they substitute a <i>promise</i> for an intended
<i>prediction</i>. Several errors of this
kind have escaped the notice of the most
celebrated writers.</p>

<p>"Without having attended to this, we
<i>will</i> be at a loss in understanding several
passages in the classics, which relate to the
public speaking, and the theatrical entertainments
of the ancients."&mdash;&mdash;Blair's Lectures,
p. 48. Philad. edit.</p>

<p>"In the Latin language, there are no
two words, we <i>would</i> more readily take to
be synonimous, than <i>amare</i> and <i>diligere</i>."&mdash;&mdash;The
same, p. 83.</p>

<p>In these and several other instances
which occur in Blair's writings, the words
<i>will</i> and <i>would</i> are used very improperly,
for <i>shall</i> and <i>should</i>. The author means
only to <i>foretell</i> certain events, and has employed
words which carry, to an English
ear, the full force of a <i>promise</i>.</p>

<p>English writers have rarely fallen into
this error; yet a few instances may be
found in authors of reputation.</p>

<p>"If I draw a catgut or any other cord
to a great length between my fingers, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
<i>will</i> make it smaller than it was before,"
&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Goldsmith's Survey of Experimental
Philosophy, book 2. chap. 2.</p>

<p>In the middle and southern states of America,
this error is frequent, both in writing
and conversation.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose the charter repealed
and the bank annihilated; <i>will</i> we be better
situated?"&mdash;&mdash;Argument against repealing
the charter of the Bank of North
America.</p>

<p>This is very incorrect; there is hardly
a possible case, in which <i>will</i> can be properly
employed to ask a question in the first
person.</p>

<p>"As soon as the diploma is made out, I
<i>will</i> have the honor to transmit it to you."&mdash;&mdash;Letter
to Count Rochambeau.</p>

<p>Is not this <i>promising</i> to have the honor of
a communication, an engagement which
delicacy forbids? It is impossible for a foreigner
to have a just idea of the absurdity
of using <i>will</i> in this manner; but a correct
English ear revolts at the practice.</p>

<p>Dr. Priestley observes very justly, that
the form of the auxiliaries, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
which is generally conditional, viz. <i>should</i>
and <i>would</i>, is elegantly used to express a
slight assertion, with modest diffidence.</p>

<p>"The royal power, <i>it should seem</i>, might
be intrusted in their hands."&mdash;&mdash;Hume's
History, vol. 3. p. 383.</p>

<p>We say also, "I <i>would</i> not choose any."
In these cases, the verbs are not conditional;
they modestly declare a fact, and therefore
properly belong to the indicative mode.
But in the following passage, <i>should</i> is improperly
employed:</p>

<p>"In judging only from the nature of
things, and without the surer aid of divine
revelation, one <i>should</i> be apt to embrace
the opinion of Diodorus Siculus,"
&amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Warburton's Divine Legation, vol.
2. p. 81.</p>

<p><i>Should</i>, in the second and third persons,
expresses <i>duty</i>, and the idea of the author
was, to express an event, under a condition,
or a modest declaration; he <i>should</i>
have used <i>would</i>.</p>

<p>"There is not a girl in town, but let her
have her will in going to a mask, and she
<i>shall</i> dress as a shepherdess."&mdash;&mdash;Spect. No. 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Shall</i>, in this example, expresses <i>command</i>,
an idea very different from the author's
meaning.</p>

<p>"Think what reflection <i>shall</i> most probably
arise."&mdash;&mdash;Blair, Serm. 9.</p>

<p>"A person, highly entertained at a
play, <i>shall</i> remember perfectly the impression
made on him by a very moving scene."&mdash;&mdash;Nugent's
Trans. of Condillac, p. 1. s. 1.</p>

<p>I would just remark here, that the errors
in the use of the auxiliary verbs before
mentioned, are not English; that they
are little known among the inhabitants of
South Britain, and still less among their
descendants in New England. This is a
new proof of the force of national customs.
I do not remember to have heard
once in the course of my life, an improper
use of the verbs <i>will</i> and <i>shall</i>, among the
unmixed English descendants in the eastern
states.</p>

<p>But of all the errors or inaccuracies in
speaking or writing the English language,
the most numerous class appear in the improper
use of verbs in the subjunctive
mode. Not only illiterate men, but authors
of the first rank, often use the pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>ent
tense for the future, the future for the
present, and the past for both.</p>

<p>"If any member <i>absents</i> himself, he
shall forfeit a penny for the use of the club,
unless in case of sickness and imprisonment."&mdash;&mdash;Rules
of the Two Penny Club, Spect. No. 9.</p>

<p>"If thou <i>neglectest</i> or <i>dost</i> unwillingly
what I command, I'll rack thee with old
cramps."&mdash;&mdash;Temp. act 1. s. 4.</p>

<p>In both these examples, the events mentioned
in the verbs are <i>future</i>; "if any
member <i>shall</i> absent himself;" "if thou
<i>shalt</i> neglect;" therefore the auxiliary verb
<i>shall</i> should have been employed, or the
sentences should have been elliptical, "if
any member <i>absent</i> himself;" "if thou <i>neglect</i>;"
where <i>shall</i> is understood and easily
supplied by the reader.</p>

<p>Numberless examples of the same kind
of inaccuracy may be found in good authors.
Thus in Haley's Happy Prescription,
act 2.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And if my scheme <i>prospers</i>, with joy I'll confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a whimsical trifle produced our success."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The idea is, "if my scheme <i>shall</i> prosper;"
and this is obvious by the subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
part of the sentence, where the future is
employed, "with joy <i>I'll</i> confess."</p>

<p>"If Punch <i>grows</i> extravagant, I shall
reprimand him very freely; if the stage
<i>becomes</i> a nursery of folly and impertinence,
I shall not be afraid to animadvert upon
it."&mdash;&mdash;Spect. No. 35.</p>

<p>These should have been <i>grow</i> or <i>should
grow</i>; <i>become</i> or <i>should become</i>.</p>

<p>"If any thing <i>offers</i> (shall offer) from
Dublin, that may serve either to satisfy
or divert you, I will not fail," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Swift's
Corresp. letter 2.</p>

<p>In the following passage, the same writer
is much more correct.</p>

<p>"If any one matter in it <i>prove</i> (that is,
<i>shall prove</i>) false, what do you think will
become of the paper?"&mdash;&mdash;Letter 8.</p>

<p>But the use of the future for the present
is much more frequent.</p>

<p>"If reverence, gratitude, obedience and
confidence <i>be</i> our duty."&mdash;&mdash;Priestley, let.
7 to a Phil. Unbeliever.</p>

<p>"If he <i>have</i> any knowlege of actual existence,
he must be satisfied."&mdash;&mdash;Same,
letter 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The author doubtless intended these sentences
to be strictly grammatical, by placing
the verbs in the present tense of the
subjunctive. But in the first example, <i>be</i> is
wrong even on Lowth's principles. The rule
of the Bishop, with respect to the use of the
indicative and subjunctive modes, is this:
That when something conditional, hypothetical,
or doubtful, is expressed, the verb
should be in the subjunctive mode; but
when the fact is certain, or taken for granted,
the verb should be in the indicative.
He gives for examples of the former, several
passages from scripture: "If thou <i>be</i> the
son of God." Matth. iv. 3. "Tho he <i>slay</i>
me, yet will I trust in him." Job xiii. 15.
"Unless he <i>wash</i> his flesh." Lev. xxii. 6.
"No power except it <i>were</i> given from above."
John xix. 11. "Whether it <i>were</i>
I or they, so we preach." 1 Cor. xv. 11.
"The subjunctive in these instances," says
the Bishop, "implies something contingent
or doubtful; the indicative would express
a more absolute and determinate sense."
To illustrate the latter part of his rule,
he quotes a passage from Atterbury's Sermons.
"Tho he <i>were</i> divinely inspired,
and spake therefore as the oracles of God,
with supreme authority; tho he <i>were</i>
endued with supernatural powers," &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
That our Savior was divinely inspired,
and endued with supernatural powers,
are positions that are here taken for granted,
as admitting not of the least doubt;
they would therefore have been better expressed
in the indicative mode; "tho he <i>was</i>
divinely inspired," &amp;c. Even on these principles,
the verb in the first example from
Priestley, just quoted, should have been in
the indicative; for there is no doubt that
reverence, gratitude, &amp;c. <i>are</i> our duty to the
Supreme Being.</p>

<p>But I apprehend, that however just Lowth's distinction between the
modes, may have formerly been, it is not warranted by the present
idiom of the language. Indeed I cannot think the rule just. In the
<i>first</i>, <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> examples quoted by the Bishop, the
indicative might be substituted for the subjunctive, and the passages
rendered more correct, according to the present practice of speaking
and writing. "If thou <i>art</i> the son of God." "No power except it
<i>was</i> given from above." "Whether it <i>was</i> I, or they, so we preach."
Every English ear must acknowlege that these expressions are more
agreeable to our present practice, than those employed by<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the translators of the Bible, and they convey an idea of condition
or doubt, as fully as the other form. But why did the translators
deviate from the original? In the Greek, the verbs, in the two first
examples, are in the indicative mode; and in the last, the verb is
not expressed. &#917;&#953; &#965;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#953;
&#964;&#959;&#965; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#965;, literally, If thou <i>art</i>
the son of God. &#927;&#965;&#954; &#949;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#962;
&#949;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#945;&#957;
&#959;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#956;&#953;&#945;&#957;
&#954;&#945;&#964;' &#949;&#956;&#959;&#965;,
&#949;&#953; &#956;&#951; &#951;&#957; &#963;&#959;&#953;
&#948;&#949;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;
&#945;&#957;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;; literally, Thou hast no power
(or authority) against me, except it <i>was</i> given thee from above.
In the last instance the verb is omitted; &#917;&#953;&#964;&#949;
&#948;&#949; &#949;&#947;&#969;, &#949;&#953;&#964;&#949;
&#949;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#953;; Whether I or they. In
these instances therefore the translators of the Bible, and Bishop
Lowth have evidently mistaken the true structure of the English verbs.
The translators deviated from the original Greek, in changing the
modes; and the Bishop has taken their error, as the foundation of a
distinction which does not exist in the language. The indicative mode
is employed to express conditional ideas, more frequently than the
subjunctive, even by the best English writers. Take the following

<p>"Here we must also observe, that tho
THOU <i>be</i> long in the first part of the verse,
it becomes short when repeated in the second."&mdash;&mdash;Sheridan's
Art of Reading.</p>

<p>The Scotch writers, who learn the English
language grammatically, are the most
particular in the use of this subjunctive form
of the verb; in consequence of which their
stile generally appears stiff and fettered.
In all the foregoing examples, and in every
instance where the affirmation respects
present time, the indicative form is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
most correct, and the only form that corresponds
with the actual present state of
the language. <i>If he says</i>, <i>if he has</i>, <i>if he
requires</i>, are the true expressions universally
used in speaking; and grammars should
exhibit and enforce this practice, rather
than amend it.</p>

<p>There are few or no English writers,
who seem to have adhered uniformly to
any rule in the use of the verbs after the
conjunctions. In consequence, either of
ignorance or inattention, the most correct
writers have fallen into inconsistencies, even
in the same sentence. This will appear
by the following examples.</p>

<p>"If life and health enough <i>fall</i> to my
share, and I <i>am</i> able to finish what I meditate."&mdash;&mdash;Bolingbroke,
let. 4, on History.</p>

<p>The author intended the verbs, <i>fall</i> and
<i>am</i>, to be in the present time; but this
would make him write nonsense; for the
events were future at the time of writing.
The first part of the sentence, to make
sense, must be considered as elliptical, "if
life and health enough <i>shall</i> or <i>should fall</i>
to my share;" in the last part therefore <i>be</i>
should be substituted for <i>am</i>, <i>if I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
able</i>: This would make the whole sentence
correct and consistent.</p>

<p>"Whether our conduct <i>be</i> inspected,
and we <i>are</i> under a righteous government,
or under no government at all."&mdash;&mdash;Priestley's
Pref. to Let. to a Phil. Unb.</p>

<p>What a confusion of modes! or rather
of tenses!</p>

<p>"Tho THOU <i>be</i> long, in the first part of
the verse," says Sheridan, in the passage just
quoted; yet soon after uses the indicative
in a phrase precisely similar; "And tho it
<i>is</i> impossible to prolong the sound of this
word." Can this great critic give a reason
for this change of modes? Such examples
serve to show at least the necessity of studying
our language with more attention,
than even many eminent scholars are willing
to bestow.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by Lowth, and
many other writers on this subject, that
"the verb itself in the present, and the auxiliary
both of the present and past imperfect
times, often carry with them somewhat
of a future sense."<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Thus, <i>if he</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><i>come tomorrow</i>, <i>if he should or would come tomorrow</i>,
carry <i>somewhat of a future sense</i>.
The writer should have gone farther, and
said that these expressions are in future
time; for they form the English future,
and belong to no other tense. This would
have been the truth, and have prevented
the numberless errors which have proceeded
from his arranging them in the
present tense of the subjunctive. Let us
attend to the following passages.</p>

<p>"This can never happen till patriotism
<i>flourish</i> more in Britain."&mdash;Home's Sketches,
book 2. s. 9.</p>

<p>"Pray heaven, he <i>prove</i> so, when you
come to him."&mdash;&mdash;Two Gent. of Verona,
act 2. s. 10.</p>

<p>"But if thou <i>linger</i> in my territories."&mdash;&mdash;Same,
act 3. s. 2.</p>

<p>"Lest, growing ruinous, the building
<i>fall</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Same, act 5. s. 6.</p>

<p>"If the second <i>be</i> pronounced thus, the
verse will be degraded into hobbling prose."&mdash;&mdash;Sheridan's
Art of Reading.</p>

<p>It is needless to multiply similar passages;
the same use of the verb, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the personal termination, occurs in almost
every page of our best writings, and it is
perfectly correct.</p>

<p>But will any person contend that the
verbs in these passages are in the present
tense? The sense is entirely future, and
could not be translated into Latin or French,
without employing the future tense. The
expressions are elliptical, and cannot be
clearly understood, without inserting <i>shall</i>
or <i>should</i> before the verbs. This pretended
present tense of the subjunctive is therefore
the real future of the indicative. To
confirm this remark, let us attend to some
other passages.</p>

<p>"Tho he <i>slay</i> me, yet will I trust in him."</p>

<p>"Unless he <i>wash</i> his flesh, he shall not
eat of the holy thing."</p>

<p>In the original Hebrew these verbs are in the future tense;
and so are most similar expressions.<a name="FNanchor_113"

sense of the foregoing verbs <i>future</i>? Are not the verbs in the
original, either in the future tense, or in the indefinite tenses,
which, in the subjunctive mode, <i>usually</i> have the sense of the

we consider the English verbs as in the present time? Either the
translators made a mistake, and placed the verbs in a wrong tense;
or Lowth and his followers have mistaken the tense, and called that
present which is really future.</p>

<p>That the fault is, in some measure, to be
ascribed to the translators, is evident from
their using the same form of the verb, after
a conjunction, when the original Greek
is in the present of the indicative.</p>

<p>1 Cor. xvi. 22.&mdash;If any man <i>love</i> not the
Lord Jesus Christ, let him be, &amp;c.&#917;&#953;

&amp;c.</p>

<p>1 Cor. xiv. 37.&mdash;If any man think
himself a prophet. &#917;&#953; &#948;&#949;
&#964;&#953;&#962; &#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#953;
&#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#951;&#962;
&#949;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#953;. 38.&mdash;If any man <i>be</i>

&#964;&#953;&#962; &#945;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#953;,
&#945;&#947;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#964;&#969;.</p>

<p>In these instances, the verbs express conditional
facts in the present time. In the
original they are in the indicative present;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and on what authority did the translators
introduce a different mode in English?
Can they be justified by the idioms of the
language at the time when they lived?
Was the subjunctive always used after a
conjunction? By no means: Their own
translation of other passages proves the
contrary.</p>

<p>1 Cor. xv. 13.&mdash;And if there <i>is</i> no
resurrection of the dead. &#917;&#953; &#948;&#949;
&#945;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;
&#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#959;&#965;&#954;
&#949;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;.</p>

<p>Here is the present tense of the indicative
used, where the fact mentioned is supposed,
by the argument, to be at least
doubtful. In other places the present time
of the same mode is used, where the future
would have been more accurate.</p>

<p>Prov. ii. 3, 4.&mdash;"Yea if thou <i>criest</i> after
knowlege, and <i>liftest</i> up thy voice for understanding;
if thou <i>seekest</i> for her as for hid
treasures, then shalt thou understand," &amp;c.</p>

<p>What conclusion shall we draw from
this state of facts? This at least may be
said with safety, either that the English
modes and tenses have not been ascertained
and understood, or that the best of our
writers have been extremely negligent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>After an attentive and accurate examination
of this subject, I believe I may venture
to assert, that nine times out of ten, when
the pretended subjunctive form of the verb
is used after a conjunction, either in the vulgar
translation of the Bible, or in our best
profane authors, the sense is actually future,
and to render the sentences complete,
it would be necessary to insert <i>shall</i> or <i>should</i>.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
This will be more obvious by attending
to the Latin translation of the New Testament,
where the future is almost always
employed to express the Greek future and
aorists. <i>Igitur si munus tuum attuleris ad
altare</i>&mdash;If thou <i>bring</i> thy gift to the altar;
<i>et illic memineris</i>&mdash;and there <i>rememberest</i>;
(what confusion of modes.) If his son
<i>ask</i> bread&mdash;<i>Si filius ejus</i> petierit <i>panem</i>. And
if the house <i>be</i> worthy&mdash;<i>Et si quidem</i> fuerit
<i>domus digna</i>; and so throughout the whole
New Testament.</p>

<p>Will any person pretend to say that the
verbs <i>bring</i>, <i>ask</i> and <i>be</i>, in the foregoing
passages, are present time; or that <i>rememberest</i>
is not bad English? The elliptical
future, <i>If thou be</i>, <i>if he ask</i>, &amp;c. is correct
English, but should by no means be confounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>with the present tense, which, in
English, has but one form.</p>

<p>I do not deny that good authors have
used this form, after conjunctions, in the
present time; but I deny that the genius
of the language requires it, that it is agreeable
to the ancient or modern elegant languages,
and that it has been or is now the
general practice.</p>

<p>With respect to the ancient practice,
examples sufficient have been already produced,
to show that authors have considered
the present of the indicative, after conjunctions,
denoting uncertainty or doubt,
as at least correct; and the present practice
in speaking is wholly on this side of
the argument.</p>

<p>With respect to the Roman and Greek
languages, I believe examples enough may
be brought to prove, that the subjunctive
mode after the conditional conjunctions or
adverbs, was not generally used, except
when the idea was such as we should express
by <i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>let</i>, or some other
auxiliary before the verb. "Quid est
autem, quod deos <i>veneremur</i> propter admirationem
ejus natur&aelig;, in qua egregium ni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>hil
videmus?" "Ut, quos ratio non posset,
eos ad officium religio <i>duceret</i>."&mdash;Cicero,
De nat Deorum, l. <span class="smcap">I</span>. 42. To render
<i>veneremur</i> and <i>duceret</i> into English, <i>should</i>
may be prefixed to <i>adore</i>, and <i>might</i> to
<i>lead</i>.</p>

<p>At any rate, the conditional conjunctions
do not all, nor generally require the
subjunctive mode: "Qu&aelig;, <i>si</i> mundus <i>est</i>
Deus, quoniam mundi partes sunt, Dei
membra parim ardentia, partim refrigerata
dicenda sunt."&mdash;Ibm. 1. <span class="smcap">I</span>. 10. "<i>Si</i> Di
<i>possunt</i> esse sine sensu," &amp;c. The indicative
after this conjunction occurs frequently in
the best Roman authors.</p>

<p>In Greek the case is nearly the same.
Several instances of the indicative after the
conditional conjunction &#949;&#953; (if) have already
been quoted from scripture; and similar
instances without number may be produced
from profane writers.</p>

ask for a greater force."</p>

<p>In French, the conditional conjunctions
do not require the subjunctive mode. "Si
ma pr&eacute;diction <i>est</i> fausse, vous serez libre de
nous immoler dans trois jours."&mdash;Telemaque,
liv. 1. "S'il <i>est</i> vrai que vous aimiez
la justice."&mdash;Liv. 4. If my prediction
<i>is</i> false&mdash;if it <i>is</i> true&mdash;are correct modes of
speaking in French. No argument therefore
in favor of the use of the English subjunctive,
can be drawn from the analogy of
other languages.</p>

<p>But this subjunctive form is not agreeable
to the structure of the language. It
has been demonstrated that our conjunctions
are mostly old Saxon verbs in the
imperative mode. Let us resolve some
sentences where the subjunctive form is
used; for example, the passages before
quoted.</p>

that these stones be made bread."&mdash;&mdash;Matth.
iv. 3.</p>

<p>Resolved&mdash;"Thou be the son God,
give that, command," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Tho he slay me, yet will I trust in
him."</p>

<p>Resolved&mdash;"He slay me, grant it, yet
will I trust in him."</p>

<p>This is the literal construction of those
sentences; the two first are present time,
the last, which is future, is merely elliptical.</p>

<p>If therefore, <i>I be</i>, <i>he have</i>, are good English
in the present tense of the indicative,
the foregoing are correct expressions; if
not, they are incorrect; for every such conditional
sentence is resolvable into two or
more declaratory phrases. Let us substitute
the Latin derivative, which precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
answers to <i>if</i>, viz. <i>suppose</i>; thus, in place
of "if thou be the son of God," write,
"<i>suppose</i> thou be the son of God," does not
every ear acknowlege the impropriety?
The only difference between the two expressions
is this; <i>if</i> is a <i>Saxon</i> verb in the
imperative mode, and <i>suppose</i>, a <i>Latin</i> one
in the same mode.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>be</i>, it may be said very
justly, that it was anciently used after the
conjunctions in almost all cases. But it
must be observed also, it was used <i>without</i>
the conjunctions. Be, from the Saxon <i>beon</i>,
is the true radical verb, still preserved
in the German, <i>Ich bin</i>, I be, <i>du bist</i>, thou
beest, in the indicative. The old English
writers employed <i>be</i> in the same mode and
tense.</p>

<p>"O, there <i>be</i> players that I have seen
play."&mdash;&mdash;Shakesp. Hamlet to the Players.</p>

<p>"They that <i>be</i> drunken, are drunken in
the night."&mdash;&mdash;1 Thess. v. 7.</p>

<p>"As we <i>be</i> slanderously reported."&mdash;&mdash;Rom.
iii. 8.</p>

<p>The common people in New England
still employ <i>be</i> in the present tense of the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>dicative,
except in the third person. They
almost universally say, <i>I be</i>, <i>we be</i>, <i>you be</i>,
and <i>they be</i>. While <i>be</i> remained the proper
substantive verb in the indicative, it was
very correctly employed after the conjunctions,
<i>If he be</i>, <i>tho he be</i>, but when, <i>am</i>, <i>are</i>,
<i>art</i> and <i>is</i> were substituted in the indicative,
they should likewise have been employed
in the subjunctive; for the latter is
resolvable into the former.</p>

<p>From the facts produced, and the remarks
made, we may draw the following
conclusions; that the distinction made by
grammarians between the present tense of
the indicative and subjunctive mode in
English, is not well founded; that it is not
warranted by the construction of the language,
nor by the analogy of other languages;
that the expressions commonly
supposed to be in the present tense of the
subjunctive, are mostly in fact an elliptical
form of the future in the indicative, and
that the present translation of the Bible
cannot be vindicated on any other supposition;
that the present practice, both in
speaking and writing, is generally in favor
of the indicative after the conjunctions;
and consequently, that the arrangement of
the verbs by Lowth and his followers, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
calculated to lead both foreigners and natives
into error.</p>

<p>I have been more particular upon this
article, because the Scotch writers, many
of whom stand among the first authors of
the British nation, follow the usual grammatical
division of verbs, and thus write a
stile not conformed to the present practice
of speaking.</p>

<p>In the use of what is called the <i>imperfect</i>
tense, after the conjunctions, there is something
peculiar, which has not yet been sufficiently
explained. On examination it
will probably be found that custom has
established one singular distinction in the
sense of verbs in different tenses, a knowlege
of which is necessary to enable us to
speak and write with precision. This distinction
will readily be understood by a
few examples.</p>

<p>A servant calls on me for a book,
which his master would borrow. If I am
uncertain whether I have that book or not,
I reply in this manner; "If the book <i>is</i> in
my library, or if I <i>have</i> the book, your
master shall be welcome to the use of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>But if I am certain I do not possess the
book, the reply is different; "I have not
the book you mention; if I <i>had</i>, it should
be at your master's service."</p>

<p>Both these forms of speaking are correct;
but the question is, what is the difference?
It cannot be in <i>time</i>; for both
refer to the same. The ideas both respect
present time; "If I <i>have</i> it <i>now</i>, it <i>shall</i> be
at your master's service"&mdash;"If I <i>had</i> it <i>now</i>,
it <i>should</i> be." The distinction in the meaning
is universally understood, and is simply
this; the first expresses <i>uncertainty</i>; the
last implies <i>certainty</i>, but in a peculiar
manner; for an affirmative sentence implies
a positive negation; and a negative
sentence implies a positive affirmation.
Thus, <i>if I had the book</i>, implies a positive
denial of having it; <i>if I had not the book</i>,
implies that I have it: And both speak of
possessing or not possessing it at this <i>present</i>
time.</p>

<p>The same distinction runs thro all the
verbs in the language. A man, shut up in
an interior apartment, would say to his
friend, "<i>if it rains</i> you cannot go home."
This would denote the speaker's uncertainty.
But on coming to the door and ascertaining
the fact, he would say, "<i>if it rain</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span><i>ed</i>,
you should not go;" or, "<i>if it did not
rain</i>, you might go." Can these verbs be
in <i>past</i> time? By no means; <i>if it did not
rain now, you could go</i>, is present, for the
present existence of the fact prevents the
man from going.</p>

<p>These forms of speech are established
by unanimous consent in practice.</p>

<p>"It remaineth that they who have
wives, be as tho they <i>had</i> none, and they
that weep, as tho they <i>wept</i> not; and they
that rejoice, as tho they <i>rejoiced</i> not; and
they that buy, as tho they <i>possessed</i> not."&mdash;&mdash;1
Cor. vii. 29, 30.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>"Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt
the legs, as if they <i>had</i> gyves on."&mdash;&mdash;1
Henry IV.</p>

<p>"We have not these antiquities; and if
<i>we had</i> them, they would add to our uncertainty."&mdash;&mdash;Bolingbroke
on Hist. let. 3.</p>

<p>"Whereas, <i>had</i> I (if I had) still the
same woods to range in, which I once <i>had</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>when I was a fox hunter, I should not resign
my manhood for a maintenance."&mdash;&mdash;Spect.
No. 14.</p>

<p>"I confess I have not great taste for poetry;
but if <i>I had</i>, I am apt to believe I
should read none but Mr. Pope's."<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>&mdash;&mdash; Shenstone
on Men and Manners.</p>

<p>Whatever these verbs may be in declaratory
phrases, yet after the conditional
conjunctions <i>if</i> and <i>tho</i>, they often express
present ideas, as in the foregoing examples.
In such cases, this form of the verb may
be denominated the <i>hypothetical</i> present
tense. This would distinguish it from the
same form, when it expresses uncertainty
in the past time; for this circumstance
must not be passed without notice. Thus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>"If he <i>had</i> letters by the last mail," denotes
the speaker's uncertainty as to a past
fact or event. But, "if <i>he had</i> a book, he
would lend it," denotes a present certainty
that he has it not. The times referred to
are wholly distinct.</p>

<p>As the practice of all writers and good
speakers, and even of the vulgar, is nearly
uniform in the distinction here mentioned,
it is needless to produce more examples for
illustration. One verb however deserves a
separate consideration; which is <i>be</i>. In
the use of this verb in the hypothetical
sense, there is a difference between good
authors and common parlance; the first
write <i>were</i>, but most people in conversation
say, <i>was</i>. Thus,</p>

<p>"Every rich man has usually some sly
way of jesting, which would make no great
figure, <i>were</i> he not rich."&mdash;&mdash;Spect. No. 2.</p>

<p>"He will often argue, that if this part
of our trade <i>were</i> well cultivated, we should
gain from one nation," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Same.</p>

<p>"<i>Were</i> I (if I were) a father, I should
take a particular care to preserve my children
from these little horrors of imagination."&mdash;&mdash;Same,
No. 12.</p>

</div></div>

<p><i>Were</i>, in these examples, is the same hypothetical
present tense just described, having
not the least reference to the past.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
But in conversation, we generally hear <i>was</i>;
"if I <i>was</i> in his place;" "if he <i>was</i> here
<i>now</i>," &amp;c. and I observe that modern writers
are copying the general practice.</p>

<p>"If I <i>was</i> not afraid of being thought to
refine too much."&mdash;Boling. Refl. on Exile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<p>Both these forms have such authorities
to support them, that neither can be considered
as wholly incorrect; they are both
English. But custom will eventually establish
the latter, <i>was</i>, as the hypothetical
form of the substantive verb. It is now
almost universally used, except in books;
and the tide of general practice is irresistible.</p>

<p>The following examples will illustrate
what has been advanced.</p>

<p><i>Present time. Affirmative.</i></p>

<p>If he <i>has</i> or <i>is</i>&mdash;denotes uncertainty.
If he <i>had</i> or <i>were</i> or <i>was</i>&mdash;denote certainty

<p>I cannot close my remarks on the tenses
of the English verb, without noticing a
common error, which must have sprung
from inattention, and is perhaps too general
now to admit of correction. It is the
use of the past tense after another verb or
<i>that</i>, when the sense requires a change of
tenses. Thus,</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to say, that to every
art there <i>was</i> a system of such various and
well approved principles."&mdash;&mdash;Harris.</p>

<p>The first part of the sentence is hypothetical,
<i>suppose I were to say</i>; but the last
becomes declaratory under the supposition,
and therefore the form of the verb should
be changed to the present, indicative, <i>that
to every art there is a system</i>: For it must
be remarked that when the English speak
of general existence, they use the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>time; as, truth <i>is</i> great above all things;
the scriptures <i>are</i> a rule of faith; the heavens
<i>display</i> the glory of the Lord. The
past or the future, in such cases, would be
highly improper. Hence the absurdity of
the passage just quoted; the supposition is
that every art <i>has</i> (generally&mdash;at all times)
a system of principles.</p>

<p>"If the taxes laid by government <i>were</i>
the only ones we <i>had</i> to pay."</p>

<p>The author's meaning is, "the only
taxes we <i>have</i> to pay;" and he was probably
led into the mistake by not understanding
the preceding hypothetical verb,
<i>were</i>, which actually speaks of the present
time conditionally.</p>

<p>The error will be more striking in the
following passages.</p>

<p>"If an atheist would well consider the
arguments in this book, he would confess
there <i>was</i> a God."</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a God! And why not confess
that there <i>is</i> a God? The writer did not
consider that the first part of the sentence
is <i>conditional</i>, and that the last ought to
be <i>declaratory</i> of a fact always existing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two young men have made a discovery
that there <i>was</i> a God."&mdash;&mdash;Swift's Arg.
against Abolishing Christianity.</p>

<p>A curious discovery indeed! Were the
Dean still alive, he might find there <i>is</i> a
great inaccuracy in that passage of his
works.</p>

<p>"Yet were we to use the same word,
where the figure <i>was</i> manifest, we should
use the preposition <i>from</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Priestley,
Gram. p. 158.</p>

<p>Here is the same error, and the author
may live to correct it.</p>

<p>But of all this class of mistakes, the following
is the most palpable.</p>

<p>"I am determined to live, as if there
<i>was</i> a <i>future</i> life."&mdash;&mdash;Hammon, quoted
by Price and Priestley.</p>

<p>Hammon is an atheist, and it would
require the same abilities to reconcile the
two words <i>was future</i>, as to reconcile his
principles with the common sense of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>The following passage, from <i>Gregory's
Comparative View of the State and Faculties
of Man</i>, is remarkable for this error.</p>

<p>"Men have been taught that they <i>did</i>
(do) God acceptable service, by abstracting
themselves from all the duties they <i>owed</i>
(owe) to society; and by inflicting on
themselves the severest tortures which nature
can support. They have been taught
that it <i>was</i> (is) their duty," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"And yet one would think that this <i>was</i>
the principal use of the study of history."&mdash;&mdash;Bolingbroke
on Hist. letter 3.</p>

<p>A similar fault occurs in one of Mrs.
Thale's letters to Dr. Johnson, Aug. 9, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"&mdash;Yet I have always found the best
supplement for talk <i>was</i> writing."</p>

<p>So in Blackstone's Commentaries, book
1. chap. 7.</p>

<p>"It was observed in a former chapter,
that one of the principal bulwarks of
civil liberty, or, in other words, of the
British constitution, <i>was</i> the limitation of
the king's prerogative."</p>

<p>The observation had been made in time
past, but respecting a fact that exists <i>now</i>,
and at all times while the British constitution
exists. The sentence therefore should
run thus; "it <i>was</i> observed that one principal
bulwark of civil liberty, <i>is</i> the limitation
of the king's prerogative."</p>

<p>No fault is more common; we every
day hear such expressions as these; "If I
thought it <i>was</i> so;" "suppose I should say
she <i>was</i> handsome;" "I did not think it
<i>was</i> so late," &amp;c. <i>Was</i>, in the first and last
examples, should be the infinitive, <i>to be</i>;
and in the second, the present time, <i>is</i>.
Had proper attention been paid to our language,
so many palpable mistakes would
not have crept into practice, and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
most correct and elegant writings. Dr.
Reid is perhaps the only writer who has
generally avoided this error.</p>

<p>The Greek and Roman writers were not
guilty of such mistakes. Either the varieties
of inflection in their languages, or
superior care in the writers, made them
attentive to the nice distinctions of time.
In the following passage, the translators of
the Bible, by adhering closely to the original,
have avoided the common error before
mentioned.</p>

<p>"I <i>knew</i> thee that thou art an hard
man."&mdash;Matth. xxv. 24. "&#917;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#8001;&#964;&#953; &#963;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#953; &#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;;" literally, <i>having known</i> that thou
<i>art</i> an hard man. So also ver. 26, "Thou
wicked and slothful servant, thou <i>knewest</i>
that I <i>reap</i>, where I sowed not;" "&#951;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#8001;&#964;&#953; &#952;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#950;&#969;." Had these passages been translated
into the careless stile of modern conversation,
and even of many excellent writings,
they would have stood thus&mdash;"I knew
thee that thou <i>wast</i> an hard man"&mdash;"thou
knewest that I <i>reaped</i> where I sow not."
But the general character and conduct of
the person mentioned in this parable, are
supposed to exist at all times while he is
living; and this general nature of the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
requires the verb to be in the present time.
To confirm this remark let the sentences
be inverted; "thou art an hard man, I
knew thee to be such, or I knew it." "I
reap where I sowed not, thou knewest that."
This is an indubitable evidence of the accuracy
of the translation.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>An inversion of the order of the sentence
in the passages first quoted, will show the
common error in a most striking light.</p>

<p>"There <i>was</i> a God, two young men
have made that discovery." "Men <i>did</i>
God acceptable service, by abstracting themselves,
&amp;c. they have been taught this; it
<i>was</i> their duty, they have been taught this."
"The taxes we <i>had</i> to pay to government,
if these were the only ones." This will
not make sense to a man who <i>has</i> taxes <i>still</i>
to pay; the writer's <i>had to pay</i> will not discharge
the public debt. But it is unnecessary
to multiply examples and arguments;
the reader must be already convinced that
these errors exist, and that I ought not to
have been the first to notice them.</p>

<p>Sometimes this hypothetical tense is
used with an infinitive for the future. In
the following passage it seems to be correct.</p>

<p>"I wish I <i>were</i> to go to the Elysian
fields, when I die, and then I should not
care if I <i>were</i> to leave the world tomorrow."&mdash;&mdash;Pope.</p>

<p>But the following are hardly vindicable.</p>

<p>"Suppose they <i>marched</i> up to our mines
with a numerous army, how could they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
subsist for want of provision."&mdash;&mdash;Moyle,
Diss. on the Rev. of Athens.</p>

<p>"If they <i>foraged</i> in small parties."&mdash;&mdash;Same.</p>

<p>The sense is future, and therefore <i>should
march</i>, <i>should forage</i>, would have been more
correct.</p>

<p>"I should not act the part of an impartial
spectator, if I <i>dedicated</i> the following
papers to one who is not of the most
consummate and acknowleged merit."&mdash;&mdash;Spect.
Dedic.</p>

<p><i>If I should dedicate</i>, would have been
more accurate.</p>

<p>A similar fault occurs in the following
passage.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If nature <i>thunder'd</i> in his opening ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>stunn'd</i> him with the music of the spheres."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Pope, Essay on Man.<br />
</p>

<p>If nature <i>should thunder</i> and <i>stun</i> him, is
the meaning.</p>

<p>There is another article that deserves
to be mentioned; which is, the use of a
verb after <i>as</i> or <i>than</i>, apparently without a
nominative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"This unlimited power is what the best
legislators of all ages have endeavored to
deposit in such hands, as <i>would preserve</i> the
people from rapine."&mdash;&mdash;Swift, vol. 2.
Contests, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<i>Would preserve</i>" seems to have no
nominative, for <i>hands</i> cannot be inserted
without changing the form of the sentence;
<i>in those hands which would preserve</i>.</p>

<p>"A hypocrite hath so many things to
attend to, <i>as make</i> his life a very perplexed
and intricate thing."&mdash;&mdash;Tillotson.</p>

<p>This mode of expression is however well
established and occasions no obscurity.
The truth is, <i>as</i> is an article or relative equivalent
to <i>that</i> or <i>which</i>; and the criticisms
of Lowth on the conjunctions, where
he condemns the use of <i>as</i> and <i>so</i> in a number
of instances, prove that he knew nothing
about the true meaning of these words.
See Diversions of Purley, page 283.</p>

<p>Another form of expression, peculiar
to our language, is the <i>participial noun</i>, a
word derived from a verb, and having the
properties, both of a verb and a noun; as,
"I heard of <i>his acquiring</i> a large estate."
<i>Acquiring</i> here expresses the <i>act done</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
acquisition; yet governs the following objective
case, <i>estate</i>. When a noun precedes
the participle, it takes the sign of the possessive,
"I heard of a <i>man's acquiring</i> an
estate." This is the genuin English idiom;
and yet modern writers very improperly
omit the sign of the possessive, as, I
heard of a <i>man acquiring</i> an estate. This
omission often changes the sense of the
phrase or leaves it ambiguous.</p>

<p>The omission of the sign of the possessive
in the following example is a very great
fault.</p>

<p>"Of a general or public act, the courts
of law are bound to take notice judicially
and <i>ex officio</i>, without the <i>statute being</i>
particularly pleaded."&mdash;&mdash;Blackstone Comment.
vol. 1. p. 86.</p>

<p>The preposition <i>without</i> here governs
the phrase following, which might otherwise
be properly arranged thus, without
<i>the particular pleading of the statute</i>, or
without <i>pleading the statute particularly</i>.
But as the sentence stands, there is nothing
to show the true construction, or how the
sentence may be resolved: <i>Being</i> and <i>pleaded</i>
both stand as participles; whereas the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
construction requires that they should be
considered as standing for a noun; for
<i>without</i> does not govern <i>statute</i>; <i>without the
statute</i>, is not the meaning of the writer. But
it governs <i>pleading</i>, or refers immediately to
that idea or union of ideas, expressed by <i>being
particularly pleaded</i>. As these last words
represent a noun, which is immediately
governed by the preposition, <i>without</i>, the
word <i>statute</i> should have the sign of the
possessive, as much as any word in the genitive
case, <i>without the statute's being particularly
pleaded</i>; that is, without the particular
pleading <i>of the statute</i> by the parties;
for in order to make grammar or sense,
<i>statute</i> must be in the possessive.</p>

<p>To confirm these remarks, I would just
add, that when we substitute a pronoun in
such cases, we always use the possessive case.
Suppose the word <i>statute</i> had been previously
used, in the sentence; the writer then
would have used the pronoun in the close
of the sentence, thus; "without <i>its</i> being
particularly pleaded;" and I presume that
no person will contend for the propriety
of, "without <i>it</i> being pleaded."</p>

<p>So we should say, "a judge will not
proceed to try a criminal, without <i>his</i> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ing
present." But would it be correct to
say, without <i>him</i> being present? This
mode of speaking will not, I am confident,
be advocated: But unless I am mistaken,
this last expression stands on a footing
with the example cited, <i>without the
statute being pleaded</i>. Numberless similar
examples occur in those modern writers
who aim at refinement of language. "If
we can admit the doctrine of the <i>stomach
having</i> a general consent with the whole
system."&mdash;"On account of the <i>system being</i>
too highly toned," &amp;c. It is strange the
writers of such language do not see that
there are in fact two possessives in such
phrases&mdash;"on account <i>of</i> the too high toning
<i>of</i> the system," and that both should be
expressed; thus, "on account <i>of</i> the <i>system's</i>
being too high toned."</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether the verb
<i>need</i> may not with propriety be used in the
third person singular of the indicative,
present, without the usual termination of
that person. Practice will at least warrant
it.</p>

<p>"But tho the principle is to be applauded,
the error cannot, and, in this enlightened
age, happily <i>need</i> not be defended."&mdash;&mdash;Erskine,
Orat. Temp. vol. 1. p. 95.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now a person <i>need</i> but enter into himself
and reflect on the operations of his
own mind."&mdash;&mdash;Nugent's Burlamaqui, 1. <span class="smcap">I.</span> 9.</p>

<p>"Hence it was adjudged, that the use
<i>need</i> not always be executed the instant the
conveyance is made."&mdash;&mdash;Blackstone, Com.
b. 2. chap. 20.</p>

<p>Numberless authorities of this kind
may be produced; but we may spare the
trouble, and only advert to the constant
practice of speakers of every class; "he
need not;" "it need not." Indeed, <i>he needs
not</i>, altho grammatically correct, is so offensive
to most ears, that we have little
reason to expect people will be persuaded
to use it.</p>

<p>The same may be said of <i>dare</i>; "he dare
not."</p>

<p><i>I am mistaken</i>, Lowth reprobates as bad
English; asserting that the phrase is equivalent
to <i>I am misunderstood</i>. In this criticism
the Bishop <i>is mistaken</i> most grossly.
Whether the phrase is a corruption of <i>am
mistaking</i> or not, is wholly immaterial; in
the sense the English have used it from
time immemorial and universally, <i>mistaken</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
is a mere adjective, signifying that one is
in an error; and this sense the Bishop
should have explained, and not rejected the
phrase.</p>


<h3>PARTICLES.</h3>

<p>The same author disapproves of <i>to</i> after
<i>averse</i>; another example of his hasty
decision. The practice of good writers
and speakers is almost wholly in favor of
<i>to</i>, and this is good authority; the propriety
of the English particles depending almost
solely on their use, without any reference
to Latin rules. <i>Averse</i> is an adjective,
describing a certain state or quality
of the mind, without regard to motion,
and therefore <i>averse from</i> is as improper as
<i>contrary from</i>, <i>opposed from</i>, or <i>reluctant from</i>.
Indeed in the original sense of <i>from</i>, explained
by Mr. Horne Tooke, as denoting
<i>beginning</i>, <i>averse from</i> appears to be nonsense.</p>

<p>The following phrases are said to be
faulty; <i>previous to</i>, <i>antecedent to</i>, with others
of a similar nature. The criticism on
these expressions must have been made on
a very superficial view of the subject. In
this sentence, "previous to the establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>ment
of the new government, the resolutions
of Congress could not be enforced by
legal compulsory penalties;" <i>previous</i> refers
to the word <i>time</i> or something equivalent
implied, <i>at the time previous</i>, or <i>during
the time or period, previous</i> to the establishment
of the new government. This is the
strict grammatical resolution of the phrase;
and the usual correction, <i>previously</i>, is
glaringly absurd; <i>during the time previously
to the establishment</i>; into such wild errors
are men led by a slight view of things, or
by applying the principles of one language
to the construction of another.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>"<i>Agreeable to his promise</i>, he sent me
the papers;" here <i>agreeable</i> is correct; for
it refers to the fact done; he sent me the
papers, which sending was agreeable to his
promise. In such cases, practice has often
a better foundation than the criticisms
which are designed to change it.</p>

<p><i>According</i> is usually numbered among
the prepositions; but most absurdly; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>always a participle, and has always a reference
to some noun or member of a sentence.
"<i>According to his promise</i>, he called
on me last evening." Here <i>according</i> refers
to the whole subsequent member of
the sentence; "he called on me last evening,
which (the whole of which facts) was
<i>according</i> to his promise." No person pretends
that "<i>accordingly</i> to his promise" is
good English; yet the phrase is not more
incorrect than "<i>agreeably</i> to his promise,"
or "<i>previously</i> to this event," which the
modern critics and refiners of our language
have recommended.</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> do you speak <i>to</i>?" "<i>Who</i> did he
marry?" are challenged as bad English;
but <i>whom</i> do you speak <i>to</i>? was never used
in speaking, as I can find, and if so, is
hardly English at all. There is no doubt,
in my mind, that the English <i>who</i> and the
Latin <i>qui</i>, are the same word with mere variations
of dialect. <i>Who</i>, in the Gothic or
Teutonic, has always answered to the Latin
nominative, <i>qui</i>; the dative <i>cui</i>, which
was pronounced like <i>qui</i>, and the ablative
<i>quo</i>; in the same manner as <i>whose</i> has answered
to <i>cujus</i>, in all genders; <i>whom</i> to
<i>quem</i>, <i>quam</i>, and <i>what</i> to <i>quod</i>. So that
<i>who</i> did he speak <i>to</i>? <i>Who</i> did you go <i>with</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
were probably as good English, in ancient
times, as <i>cui dixit?</i> <i>Cum quo ivisti?</i> in Latin.
Nay, it is more than probable that
<i>who</i> was once wholly used in asking questions,
even in the objective case; <i>who</i> did
he marry? until some Latin student began
to suspect it bad English, because not agreeable
to the Latin rules. At any rate,
<i>whom</i> do you speak <i>to</i>? is a corruption,
and all the grammars that can be formed
will not extend the use of the phrase beyond
the walls of a college.</p>

<p>The foregoing criticisms will perhaps
illustrate and confirm an assertion of Mr.
Horne Tooke, that "Lowth has rejected
much <i>good</i> English." I should go farther
and assert that he has criticized away more
phrases of <i>good</i> English, than he has corrected
of <i>bad</i>. He has not only mistaken
the true construction of many phrases, but
he has rejected others that have been used
generally by the English nation from the
earliest times, and by arbitrary rules, substituted
phrases that have been rarely, or
never used at all. To detect such errors,
and restrain the influence of such respectable
names, in corrupting the true idiom of
our tongue, I conceive to be the duty of
every friend to American literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>On examining the language, and comparing
the practice of speaking among the
yeomanry of this country, with the stile of
Shakespear and Addison, I am constrained
to declare that the people of America, in
particular the English descendants, speak
the most <i>pure English</i> now known in the
world. There is hardly a foreign idiom
in their language; by which I mean, a
<i>phrase</i> that has not been used by the best
English writers from the time of Chaucer.
They retain a few obsolete <i>words</i>, which
have been dropt by writers, probably from
mere affectation, as those which are substituted
are neither more melodious nor expressive.
In many instances they retain
correct phrases, instead of which the pretended
refiners of the language have introduced
those which are highly improper and
absurd.</p>

<p>Let Englishmen take notice that when
I speak of the American yeomanry, the
latter are not to be compared to the illiterate
peasantry of their own country. The
yeomanry of this country consist of substantial
independent freeholders, masters of
their own persons and lords of their own
soil. These men have considerable education.
They not only learn to read, write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
and keep accounts; but a vast proportion
of them read newspapers every week, and
besides the Bible, which is found in all
families, they read the best English sermons
and treatises upon religion, ethics,
geography and history; such as the works
of Watts, Addison, Atterbury, Salmon, &amp;c.
In the eastern states, there are public
schools sufficient to instruct every man's
children, and most of the children are
actually benefited by these institutions.
The people of distant counties in England
can hardly understand one another,
so various are their dialects; but in
the extent of twelve hundred miles in America,
there are very few, I question
whether a hundred words, except such as
are used in employments wholly local,
which are not universally intelligible.</p>

<p>But unless the rage for imitating foreign
changes can be restrained, this agreeable
and advantageous uniformity will be
gradually destroyed. The standard writers
abroad give us local practice, the momentary
whims of the great, or their own
arbitrary rules to direct our pronunciation;
and we, the apes of fashion, submit
to imitate any thing we hear and see.
Sheridan has introduced or given sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
to more arbitrary and corrupt changes of
pronunciation, within a few years, than
had before taken place in a century; and
in Perry's Dictionary, not to mention the
errors in what he most arrogantly calls his
"<i>Only sure Guide</i> to the English Tongue,"
there are whole pages in which there are
scarcely two or three words marked for a
just pronunciation. There is no Dictionary
yet published in Great Britain, in
which so many of the analogies of the
language and the just rules of pronunciation
are preserved, as in the common practice
of the well informed Americans, who
have never consulted any foreign standard.
Nor is there any grammatical treatise, except
Dr. Priestley's, which has explained
the real idioms of the language, as they are
found in Addison's works, and which remain
to this day in the American practice
of speaking.</p>

<p>The result of the whole is, that we
should adhere to our own practice and general
customs, unless it can be made very
obvious that such practice is wrong, and
that a change will produce some considerable
advantage.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> It is a dispute among grammarians, whether the interjection
is a part of speech; and the question, like many
others upon similar subjects, has employed more learning
than common sense. The simple truth is this; the involuntary
sounds produced by a sudden passion, are the language
of nature which is subject only to nature's rules.
They are, in some degree, similar among all nations. They
do not belong to a grammatical treatise, any more than the
looks of fear, surprise or any other passion. The words,
ah me! oh me! are mere exclamations, as are bless me! my
gracious! and numberless other sounds, which are uttered
without any precise meaning, and are not reduceable to any
rules.</p></div>

Is it not possible that <i>mo</i> or <i>more</i> and the French <i>mais</i> may

The following passage will confirm the foregoing explanation
of <i>beutan</i>. It is taken from the Saxon version of
the Gospels.&mdash;&mdash; Luke, chap. 1. v. 74. of the original.
</p>
<p>
"H&aelig;t we <i>butan</i> ege of ure feonda handa alysede, him
theowrian."
</p>
<p>
This version of the Gospels was doubtless as early as the
tenth or eleventh century. In Wickliff's version, made
about three centuries later, the passage stands thus: "That
we <i>without</i> drede, delyvered fro the hand of oure enemyes,
serve to him." Where we find <i>butan</i> and <i>without</i> are synonimous.
</p>
<p>
The word <i>bot</i> or <i>bote</i> is still retained in the law language,

blending of the Greek &#954;&#945;&#953; &#959; and &#954;&#945;&#953; &#959;&#964;&#953;. This supposition

a noun, it forms an adjective, as God, <i>Godly</i>; heaven,

it has so many derivations and uses, that it has no certain

<p><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> "The present tense in English hath often the <i>sense of the
future</i>; as <i>when do you go out of town?</i> I go tomorrow: that
is, when will you, shall you go? I shall go. <i>If you do well</i>,
that is, shall do well, you will be rewarded: <i>As soon as</i>, or
<i>when you come there</i>; that is, shall come, turn on your right
hand: With these forms of speaking, the verb is always
placed in the future in Latin, Greek and Hebrew."&mdash;&mdash;Bayley's
Intro. to Lan. Lit. and Phil. 99.
</p>
<p>
This critical writer has explained this mode of speaking
with accuracy; but it would be more correct to call this
form of the verb, an <i>elliptical future</i>, than to say, <i>the present
tense has the sense of the future</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_114" id="Footnote_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> So in the law stile. "If a man <i>die</i> intestate;" "if a
man <i>die</i> seised of an estate in fee;" "if Titius <i>enfeoff</i> Gaius,"
&amp;c. are future; and in most such phrases used in translations
from the Latin and French, the verbs in the original
are future. But in law the same form is used in the present
very frequently, agreeable to the ancient practice. The
reason may be, the convenience and necessity of copying
words and phrases with great exactness. But Blackstone,
the most accurate and elegant law writer, uses the other form,
"if a man <i>has</i> heirs;" "if a good or valuable consideration
<i>appears</i>;" and too often, when the sense requires the future.
He generally gives <i>be</i> its subjunctive form, as it is called,
and most other verbs the indicative.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> In some instances, the time is present, and the ellipsis
may be supplied by <i>may</i> or some other auxiliary.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a>
In the original, the participle of the present time
is employed: &#7985;&#957;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#953;
&#949;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#962;, &#8033;&#962;
&#956;&#951; &#949;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;; and so in
the other instances. The Greek is correct; "those <i>having</i> wives as
<i>not having</i> them." The translation is agreeable enough to the English
idiom; but the verbs represent the present time.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_117" id="Footnote_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> A similar use of the verb occurs after <i>wish</i>; "<i>I wish
I had</i> my estate <i>now</i> in possession;" this would be expressed
in Latin. <i>Utinam me habere</i>, using the present of the infinitive,
or <i>Utinam ut haberem</i>; but this Imperfect tense of the
Subjunctive, both in Latin and French, is used to convey the
same ideas as English verbs after if; <i>if I had</i>, <i>si haberem</i>, <i>si
j'aurois</i>, and whatever may be the name annexed to this
form of the verb, it cannot, in the foregoing sense, have any
reference to past time.
</p>
<p>
The common phrases, <i>I had rather</i>, <i>he had better</i>, are said
to be a corruption of <i>I would rather</i>, <i>he would better</i>, rapidly
pronounced, <i>I'd rather</i>. I am not satisfied that this is a just
account of their origin; <i>would</i> will not supply the place of
<i>had</i> in all cases. At any rate, the phrases have become good
English.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_118" id="Footnote_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> The following translation of a passage in Cicero is directly
in point. "Vivo tamen in ea ambitione et labore
tanquam id, quod non postulo, <i>expectem</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Cicero ad
Quintum. 2. 15.
</p>
<p>
"I live still in such a course of ambition and fatigue, as
if <i>I were expecting</i> what I do not really desire."&mdash;&mdash;Middleton,
Life of Cicero, vol. 2. p. 97.
</p>
<p>
Here <i>tanquam expectem</i> are rendered very justly, "as if
I <i>were</i> expecting;" <i>now</i>, in present time, agreeable to the
original. The words carry a negative: <i>if I were expecting</i>,
implying, that <i>I do not expect</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_119" id="Footnote_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> This tense is not admitted to be good English; yet is
often used in speaking; the <i>have</i> being contracted or corrupted
into <i>a</i>, <i>had a written</i>, <i>if he had a received</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_120" id="Footnote_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> We have derived our substantive verb from two radical
verbs; <i>beon</i>, whence come the English <i>be</i>, and the German
<i>bist</i>; and <i>weorthan</i>, to be or <i>become</i>, fieri; from which
probably, the Danes have their <i>varer</i>, and the English
their <i>were</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_121" id="Footnote_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121"><span class="label">[121]</span></a> The great source of these errors is this: Grammarians
have considered <i>that</i> as a conjunction, and supposed that
"conjunctions couple like cases and modes;" a Latin rule
that does not always hold in English. But Mr. Horne
Tooke has clearly proved the word <i>that</i> to be always a relative
pronoun: It always relates to a word or sentence;
and the reason why grammarians have called it a conjunction,
may be this; they could not find any word to govern
it as a relative, and therefore did not know what to do with
it. But it is in fact a relative word, thus, "two men have
made a discovery;" this is one assertion. What discovery?
"<i>that</i> or <i>this</i> is the discovery;" the word <i>that</i> carrying the
force of a complete affirmation; "there <i>was</i> a God." Here
we see the absurdity of Swift's declaration and the common
notions of a subjunctive mode. There is no subjunctive;
in strictness of speech, all sentences are resolvable into distinct
declaratory phrases. "There <i>is</i> a God;" "two young
men have discovered <i>that</i>;" so the sentence should be written
to show the true construction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_122" id="Footnote_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> A passage in Dr. Middleton's Life of Cicero, is remarkably
accurate; "The celebrated orator, L. Cassius,
died of the same disease (the pleurisy,) which might probably
be then, as I <i>was</i> told in Rome it <i>is now</i>, the peculiar
distemper of the place." <i>Was</i> refers to time completely
<i>past</i>; but <i>is</i> declares a fact that exists generally, at all times;
the verb is therefore in the present tense, or as Harris terms
it,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the <i>aorist of the present</i>. So also in Dr. Reid's Essays,
vol. 1. p. 18. "Those philosophers <i>held</i>, that there <i>are</i>
three first principles of all things;" which is correct English.
"Aristotle <i>thought</i> every object of human understanding
<i>enters</i> at first by the senses."&mdash;Page 110. The following
passage is equally correct. "There is a courage
depending on nerves and blood, which <i>was</i> improved to
the highest pitch among the Greeks."&mdash;&mdash;Gillies, Hist. of
Greece, vol. 1. p. 248. This courage is derived from the
constitution of the human body; it exists therefore at <i>all
times</i>; and had our author said, "there <i>was</i> a courage depending
on nerves and blood, which the Greeks <i>improved</i>
to the highest pitch," the sense would have been left imperfect.
Here then we see the indefinite use of this form
of the present tense; for were the verb is, in the foregoing
example, limited to time <i>now present</i>, it would make the author
write nonsense; it being absurd to say, "the Greeks
2000 years ago <i>improved</i> a courage which exists only <i>at the
present time</i>." So that verbs, in the <i>present</i> tense, express
facts that have an uninterrupted existence in <i>past</i>, <i>present</i>,
and <i>future</i> time.</p></div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/image291c.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">As</span> poetry has ever been numbered
among the <i>fine arts</i>,
and has employed the pens
of the first geniuses in all
nations, an investigation of
the subject must be gratifying
to readers of taste. And it must be
the more agreeable, as it has been much
neglected, and the nature and construction
of English verse have frequently been misunderstood.</p>

<p>Most prosodians who have treated particularly
of this subject, have been guilty
of a fundamental error, in considering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
movement of English verse as depending
on long and short syllables, formed by long
and short vowels. This hypothesis has led
them into capital mistakes. The truth is,
many of those syllables which are considered
as <i>long</i> in verse, are formed by the
shortest vowels in the language; as <i>strength</i>,
<i>health</i>, <i>grand</i>. The doctrine, that long
vowels are requisite to form long syllables
in poetry, is at length exploded, and the
principles which regulate the movement
of our verse, are explained; viz. <i>accent</i> and
<i>emphasis</i>. Every emphatical word, and every
accented syllable, will form what is
called in verse, a long syllable. The unaccented
syllables, and unemphatical monosyllabic
words, are considered as short syllables.</p>

<p>But there are two kinds of emphasis;
a natural emphasis, which arises from the
importance of the idea conveyed by a word;
and an accidental emphasis, which arises
from the importance of a word in a particular
situation.</p>

<p>The first or natural emphasis belongs to
all nouns, verbs, participles and adjectives,
and requires no elevation of voice; as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not <i>half</i> so <i>swift</i> the <i>tremb</i>ling <i>doves</i> can <i>fly</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>The last or accidental emphasis is laid
on a word when it has some particular
meaning, and when the force of a sentence
depends on it; this therefore requires an
elevation of voice; as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Perdition catch my soul&mdash;but I <i>do</i> love thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So far the prosody of the English language
seems to be settled; but the rules
laid down for the construction of verse,
seem to have been imperfect and disputed.</p>

<p>Writers have generally supposed that
our heroic verse consists of five feet, all
pure Iambics, except the first foot, which
they allow may be a Trochee. In consequence
of this opinion, they have expunged
letters from words which were necessary;
and curtailed feet in such a manner as to
disfigure the beauty of printing, and in
many instances, destroyed the harmony of
our best poetry.</p>

<p>The truth is, so far is our heroic verse
from being confined to the Iambic measure,
that it admits of eight feet, and in some
instances of nine. I will not perplex my
readers with a number of hard names, but
proceed to explain the several feet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
show in what places of the line they are admissible.</p>

<p>An Iambic foot, which is the ground of
English numbers, consists of two syllables,
the first <i>short</i> and the second <i>long</i>. This
foot is admitted into every place of the line.
Example, all Iambics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wh&#277;re sl&#257;ves &#335;nce m&#333;re th&#277;ir n&#257;t&#301;ve l&#257;nd b&#277;h&#333;ld,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Glows in</i> the stars, and blossoms in the trees."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Pope.<br />
</p>

<p>The Trochee is not admissible into the
second place of the line; but in the third
and fourth it may have beauty, when it
creates a correspondence between the sound
and sense.</p>

<p>The Amphibrach is a foot of three syllables,
the first and third short, and the
second long. It is used in heroic verse only
when we take the liberty to add a short
syllable to a line.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>This foot is hardly admissible in the
solemn or sublime stile. Pope has indeed
admitted it into his Essay on Man:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What can ennoble sots or slaves &#335;r c&#333;w&#259;rds,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But these lines are of the high burlesque
kind, and in this stile the Amphibrach
closes lines with great beauty.</p>

<p>The Tribrach is a foot of three syllables,
all short; and it may be used in the third
and fourth places.</p>

<p>The Dactyl, a foot of three syllables,
the first long and the two last short, is used
principally in the first place in the line.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The Anap&aelig;st, a foot consisting of three
syllables, the two first short and the last
long, is admissible into every place of the
line.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"C&#259;n &#259; b&#333;s&#335;m s&#335; g&#275;ntl&#277; r&#277;m&#257;in,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The trissyllabic feet have suffered most
by the general ignorance of critics; most
of them have been mutilated by apostrophes,
in order to reduce them to the Iambic
measure.</p>

<p>Thus in the line before repeated,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Murmuring</i>, and with him fled the shades of night,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we find the word in the copy reduced to
two syllables, <i>murm'ring</i>, and the beauty of
the Dactyl is destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On every side with shadowy squadrons deep,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>by apostrophizing <i>every</i> and <i>shadowy</i>, the
line loses its harmony. The same remark
applies to the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And hosts infuriate shake the shudd'ring plain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But fashion so directs, and moderns raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fashion's <i>mould'ring</i> base, their transient praise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Churchill.<br />
</p>

<p>Poetic lines which abound with these
trissyllabic feet, are the most flowing and
melodious of any in the language; and yet
the poets themselves, or their printers,
murder them with numberless unnecessary
contractions.</p>

<p>It requires but little judgement and an
ear indifferently accurate, to distinguish the
contractions which are necessary, from those
which are needless and injurious to the
versification. In the following passage we
find examples of both.</p>

<p>Here <i>e</i> in <i>opera</i> ought not to be apostrophized,
for such a contraction reduces
an Amphibrachic foot to an Iambic. The
words <i>prayers</i>, <i>seven</i> and <i>heaven</i> need not
the apostrophe of <i>e</i>; for it makes no difference
in the pronunciation. But the
contraction of <i>over</i> and <i>betwixt</i> is necessary;
for without it the measure would be
imperfect.</p>


<h3>PAUSES.</h3>

<p>Having explained the several kinds of
feet, and shown in what places of a verse
they may be used, I proceed to another important
article, the pauses. Of these there
are two kinds, the <i>cesural</i> pause, which divides
the line into two equal or unequal
parts; and the <i>final</i> pause which closes the
verse. These pauses are called <i>musical</i>, because
their sole end is the melody of verse.</p>

<p>The pauses which mark the sense, and
for this reason are denominated <i>sentential</i>,
are the same in verse as in prose. They
are marked by the usual stops, a comma, a
semicolon, a colon, or a period, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
sense requires, and need no particular explanation.</p>

<p>The cesural pause is not essential to
verse, for the shorter kinds of measure are
without it; but it improves both the melody
and the harmony.</p>

<p>Melody in music is derived from a succession
of sounds; harmony from different
sounds in concord. A single voice can produce
melody; a union of voices is necessary
to form harmony. In this sense harmony
cannot be applied to verse, because
poetry is recited by a single voice. But
harmony may be used in a figurative sense,
to express the effect produced by observing
the proportion which the members of verse
bear to each other.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The cesural pause may be placed in any
part of the verse; but has the finest effect
upon the melody, when placed after the
second or third foot, or in the middle of
the third. After the second:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In what retreat, inglorious and unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did genius sleep, when dulness seized the throne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After the third:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the middle of the third:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great are his perils, in this stormy time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rashly ventures, on a sea of rhime."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In these examples we find a great degree
of melody, but not in all the same degree.
In comparing the divisions of verse, we experience
the most pleasure in viewing those
which are equal; hence those verses which
have the pause in the middle of the third
foot, which is the middle of the verse, are
the most melodious. Such is the third example
above.</p>

<p>In lines where the pause is placed after
the second foot, we perceive a smaller degree
of melody, for the divisions are not equal;
one containing four syllables, the
other six, as in the first example.</p>

<p>But the melody in this example, is much
superior to that of the verses which have
the cesural pause after the third foot; for
this obvious reason: When the pause
bounds the second foot, the latter part of
the verse is the greatest, and leaves the most
forcible impression upon the mind; but
when the pause is at the end of the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
foot, the order is reversed. We are fond
of proceeding from small to great, and a
climax in sound, pleases the ear in the same
manner as a climax in sense delights the
mind. Such is the first example.</p>

<p>It must be observed further, that when
the cesural pause falls after the second and
third feet, both the final and cesural pauses
are on accented syllables; whereas when
the cesural pause falls in the middle of the
third foot, this is on a weak syllable, and
the final pause, on an accented syllable.
This variety in the latter, is another cause
of the superior pleasure we derive from
verses divided into equal portions.</p>

<p>The pause may fall in the middle of the
fourth foot; as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let favor speak for others, worth for me;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but the melody, in this case, is almost lost.
At the close of the first foot, the pause has
a more agreeable effect.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That's vile, should we a parent's fault adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And err, because our fathers err'd before?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the middle of the second foot, the
pause may be used, but produces little melody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And who but wishes to invert the laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of order, sins against the eternal cause."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Harmony is produced by a proportion
between the members of the same verse, or
between the members of different verses.
Example.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy forests, Windsor, and thy green retreats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the monarch's, and the muse's seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invite my lays. Be present sylvan maids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlock your springs, and open all your shades."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we observe, the pause in the first
couplet, is in the middle of the third foot;
both verses are in this respect similar. In
the last couplet, the pause falls after the
second foot. In each couplet separately
considered, there is a uniformity; but when
one is compared with the other, there is a
diversity. This variety produces a pleasing
effect.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The variety is further encreased,
when the first lines of several succeeding
couplets are uniform as to themselves,
and different from the last lines,
which are also uniform as to themselves.
Churchill, speaking of reason, lord chief
justice in the court of man, has the following
lines.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Equally form'd to rule, in age and youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friend of virtue, and the guide to youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>her</i> I bow, whose sacred power I feel;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>her</i> decision, make my last appeal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemn'd by <i>her</i>, applauding worlds in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should tempt me to take up my pen again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By <i>her</i> absolv'd, the course I'll still pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If <i>Reason</i>'s for me, <i>God</i> is for me too."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first line of three of these couplets,
has the pause after the second foot; in this
consists their similarity. The last line in
three of them, has the pause in the middle
of the third foot; they are uniform as to
themselves, but different from the foregoing
lines. This passage, which on the
whole is very beautiful, suffers much by
the sixth line, which is not verse, but rather
hobbling prose.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing remarks are sufficient to
illustrate the use and advantages of the cesural
pause.</p>

<p>The final pause marks the close of a line
or verse, whether there is a pause in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>sense or not. Sentential pauses should be
marked by a variation of tone; but the final
pause, when the close of one line is intimately
connected with the beginning of
the next, should be merely a suspension of
the voice without elevation or depression.
Thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought death into the world, and all our woe," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When these lines are read without a
pause after the words <i>fruit</i> and <i>taste</i>, they
degenerate into prose. Indeed in many
instances, particularly in blank verse, the
final pause is the only circumstance which
distinguishes verse from prose.</p>


<h3>EXPRESSION.</h3>

<p>One article more in the construction
of verse deserves our observation, which is
<i>Expression</i>. Expression consists in such a
choice and distribution of poetic feet as are
best adapted to the subject, and best calculated
to impress sentiments upon the mind.
Those poetic feet, which end in an accented
syllable, are the most forcible. Hence
the Iambic measure is best adapted to solemn
and sublime subjects. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
measure of the Epic, of poems on grave
moral subjects, of elegies, &amp;c. The Spondee,
a foot of two long syllables, when admitted
into the Iambic measure, adds much
to the solemnity of the movement.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While the clear sun, rejoicing still to rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pomp <i>rolls round</i> immeasurable skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Dwight.<br />
</p>

<p>The Dactyl, <i>rolls round</i>, expresses beautifully
the majesty of the sun in his course.</p>

<p>It is a general rule, that the more important
syllables there are in a passage,
whether of prose or verse, the more heavy
is the stile. For example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd new piece."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men, bearded, bald, cowl'd, uncowl'd, shod, unshod."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such lines are destitute of melody and
are admissible only when they suit the sound
to the sense. In the high burlesque stile,
of which kind is Pope's Dunciad, they give
the sentiment an ironical air of importance,
and from this circumstance derive a beauty.
On the other hand, a large proportion
of unaccented syllables or particles, deprives
language of energy; and it is this circumstance
principally which in prose constitutes
the difference between the grave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>torical,
and the familiar stile. The greatest
number of long syllables ever admitted
into a heroic verse, is seven, as in the foregoing;
the smallest number is three.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or to a s&#257;d var&#299;ety of w&#333;e."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Trochaic measure, in which every
foot closes with a weak syllable, is well
calculated for lively subjects.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Softly sweet in Lydian measures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War he sung is toil and trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honor but an empty bubble," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Anap&aelig;stic measure, in which there
are two short syllables to one long, is best
adapted to express the impetuosity of passion
or action. Shenstone has used it to
great advantage, in his inimitable pastoral
ballad. It describes beautifully the strong
and lively emotions which agitate the lover,
and his anxiety to please, which continually
hurries him from one object and
one exertion to another.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have found out a gift for my fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have found where the wood pigeons breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet let me that plunder forbear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will say 'twas a barbarous deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he ne'er could prove true, she averr'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who could rob a poor bird of her young:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I lov'd her the more when I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such tenderness fall from her tongue."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>The Amphibrachic measure, in which
there is a long syllable between two short
ones, is best adapted to lively comic subjects;
as in Addison's Rosamond.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Since conjugal passion<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Has come into fashion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marriage so blest on the throne is,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Like Venus I'll shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Be fond and be fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a measure gives sentiment a ludicrous
air, and consequently is ill adapted
to serious subjects.</p>

<p>Great art may be used by a poet in
choosing words and feet adapted to his
subject. Take the following specimen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Now here, now there, the warriors fall; amain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groans murmur, armor sounds, and shouts convulse the plain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The feet in the last line are happily
chosen. The slow Spondee, in the beginning
of the verse, fixes the mind upon the
dismal scene of woe; the solemnity is
heightened by the pauses in the middle of
the second and at the end of the third foot.
But when the poet comes to shake the plains,
he closes the line with three forcible Iambics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a similar beauty take the following
example.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She all night long, her amorous descant sung."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet here designs to describe the
length of the night, and the music of the
Nightingale's song. The first he does by
two slow Spondees, and the last by four
very rapid syllables.</p>

<p>The following lines, from Gray's Elegy,
written in a country church yard, are distinguished
by a happy choice of words.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cast one <i>longing lingering</i> look behind?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words <i>longing</i> and <i>lingering</i> express
most forcibly the reluctance with which
mankind quit this state of existence.</p>

<p>Pope has many beauties of this kind.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And grace and reason, sense and virtue split,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the rash dexterity of wit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mute consonants, with which these
lines end, express the idea of <i>rending asunder</i>,
with great energy and effect. The
words <i>rash</i> and <i>dexterity</i> are also judiciously
chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>In describing the delicate sensations of
the most refined love, he is remarkable for
his choice of smooth flowing words. There
are some passages in his Eloisa and Abelard,
which are extended to considerable length,
without a single mute consonant or harsh
word.</p>


<h3><i>Of</i> READING VERSE.</h3>

<p>With respect to the art of reading
verse, we can lay down but a few simple
rules; but these may perhaps be useful.</p>

<p>1. Words should be pronounced as they
are in prose and in conversation; for reading
is but rehearsing another's conversation.</p>

<p>2. The emphasis should be observed as
in prose. The voice should bound from
accent to accent, and no stress should be
laid on little unimportant words, nor on
weak syllables.</p>

<p>3. The sentential pauses should be observed
as in prose; these are not affected
by the kind of writing, being regulated entirely
by the sense. But as the cesural and
final pauses are designed to encrease the
melody of verse, the strictest attention must
be paid to them in reading. They mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
a suspension of voice without rising or falling.</p>

<p>To read prose well it is necessary to understand
what is read; and to read poetry well, it
is further necessary to understand the structure
of verse. For want of this knowlege,
most people read all verse like the Iambic
measure. The following are pure Iambics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Above how high progressive life may go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around how wide, how deep extend below!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is so easy to lay an accent on every
second syllable, that any school boy can
read this measure with tolerable propriety.
But the misfortune is, that when a habit
of reading this kind of meter is once formed,
persons do not vary their manner to
suit other measures. Thus in reciting the
following line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Load <i>the</i> tall <i>bark</i>, and launch in<i>to</i> the main,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>many people would lay the accent on every
second syllable; and thus read, our
poetry becomes the most monotonous and
ridiculous of all poetry in the world.</p>

<p>Let the following line be repeated without
its pauses, and it loses its principal
beauty.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bold, as a hero,, as a virgin, mild."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<p>So in the following.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Reason, the card,, but passion, is the gale."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From storms, a shelter,, and from heat, a shade."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The harmony is, in all these instances,
improved much by the semipauses, and at
the same time the sense is more clearly understood.</p>

<p>Considering the difficulty of reading
verse, I am not surprised to find but few
who are proficients in this art. A knowlege
of the structure of verse, of the several
kinds of feet, of the nature and use of the
final, the cesural and the semicesural pauses,
is essential to a graceful manner of reading
poetry; and even this, without the best
examples, will hardly effect the purpose.
It is for this reason, that children should
not be permitted to read poetry of the more
difficult kind, without the best examples
for them to imitate. They frequently
contract, in early life, either a monotony
or a sing song cant, which, when grown
into a habit, is seldom ever eradicated.</p>

<p>The author of the "Specimen of an Etymological
Vocabulary," asserts that "the Celtic was
demonstrably the origin of the Greek and Latin; of
most, if not all the languages of Europe; of part of
Africa and the two Tartaries."</p>

<p>Mons. Gebelin, who has, with great industry, investigated
the origin of the European languages, is of
opinion that the Celtic was spoken from the borders of
the Hellespont to the ocean, and from Troy to Cape
Finisterre and Ireland. "La langue Celtique, dans
son sens le plus extendu, est la langue que parlerent les
premiers habitans de l'Europe, depuis les rives de l'Hellespont
&amp; de la Mer Eg&eacute;e, jusques a celle de l'Ocean;
depuis le cap Sig&eacute;e aux portes de Troie, jusques
au cap de Finisterre en Portugal, ou jusques en Irelande."&mdash;&mdash;Dis.
Prelim. art. 2.</p>

<p>From this language, he says, sprung the Greek or
Pelasgic, prior to Hesiod and Homer&mdash;the Latin or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
of Numa&mdash;the Etruscan, spoken in a considerable part
of Italy&mdash;the Thracian, spoken on the Danube, from
the Euxine to the Adriatic sea, which was the same as
the Phrygian&mdash;the Teutonic or German, spoken from
the Vistula to the Rhine&mdash;the Gaulish, spoken on the
Alps, in Italy, on this side the Po, and from the Rhine
to the Ocean, including France, the Low Countries,
Switzerland, Alemain, and the two Bretagnes&mdash;also
the Cantabrian, or ancient language of Spain&mdash;in short,
the Runic, spoken in the North, Denmark, Sweden, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The only pure remains of this primitive Celtic, the
same author supposes, are found in Wales, Cornwall,
and Brittany in France, where the people still speak dialects
of a language which is proved to be the ancient
British.</p>

<p>"Separes ainsi du reste de l'univers, ces debris des
anciens Celtes ont conserv&eacute; leurs anciens usages, &amp; parlent
une langue qui n'a aucun rapport a celles des peuples
qui les ont subjugu&eacute;s, &amp; qui s'est partag&eacute;e en trois
dialectes, le Gallois, le Cornouaillien, &amp; le Bas Breton;
dialectes qui ont entr'eux le plus grand rapport, &amp; qui
sont incontestablement les precieux restes de l'ancienne
langue des Celtes ou des Gaulois."&mdash;&mdash;Dis. Prelim.</p>

<p>"Separated from the rest of the world, these remains
of the ancient Celts have preserved their ancient
customs, and speak a language which <i>has no agreement
with those of their conquerors</i>, and which is divided into
three dialects, the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Armoric&mdash;dialects
which have a close affinity with each other,
and which are, beyond dispute, the precious remains
of the ancient Celtic or Gaulish language."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>In this passage the author seems to contradict what
he had just before advanced, that the Celtic was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>primitive language of Europe, from which sprung the
Gothic or German. Now the Franks, Normans and
Saxons, who subdued Gaul and Britain, spoke dialects
of the Gothic; consequently there must have been, upon
our author's own hypothesis, some agreement between
the ancient Celtic and the more modern languages
of the Goths, Saxons, and other northern conquerors
of the Celtic nations. This agreement will appear,
when I come to collate a number of words in the
different languages.</p>

<p>Many learned men have attempted to prove that
the Northern Goths and Teutones, and the Celts who
lived in Gaul and Britain, were originally the same people.
Mons. Mallet, the celebrated historian, has composed
his "Introduction to the History of Denmark"
upon this hypothesis. His translator is of a different
opinion, and has generally substituted the English
word "Gothic" for the "Celtique" of the original. In
a preface to his translation, he endeavors to confute the
opinion of Mons. Mallet, Cluverius, Pellutier and others,
and prove that the Gothic and Celtique nations
were <i>ab origine</i> two distinct races of men. Great erudition
is displayed on both sides of the question, and
those who have a taste for enquiries of this kind, will
receive much satisfaction and improvement, in reading
what these authors have written upon the subject.</p>

<p>After a close examination, I freely declare myself
an advocate for the opinion of Mons. Mallet, Lhuyd,
and Pellutier, who suppose the Celts and Goths to be
descended from the same original stock. The separation
however must have been very early, and probably
as early as the first age after the flood. To say that
the Gothic and Celtique languages have <i>no affinity</i>,
would be to contradict the most positive proofs; yet the
affinity is very small&mdash;discoverable only in a few words.</p>

<p>The modern English, Danish, Swedish and German
are all unquestionably derived from the same language;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
they have been spoken by distinct tribes, probably not
two thousand years, and almost one half of that period,
the sounds have been in some measure fixed by written
characters, yet the languages are become so different
as to be unintelligible, each to those who speak the other.
But, suppose two languages separated from the parent
tongue, two thousand years earlier, and to be spoken,
thro the whole of that time, by rude nations, unacquainted
with writing, and perpetually roving in forests,
changing their residence, and liable to petty conquests,
and it is natural to think their affinity must become
extremely obscure. This seems to have been the
fact with respect to the Gothic and Celtic tongues.
The common parent of both was the Phenician or Hebrew.
This assertion is not made on the sole authority
of Moses; profane history and etymology furnish
strong arguments to prove the truth of the scripture account
of the manner in which the world was peopled
from one flock or family. Of these two ancient languages,
the Celtic or British comes the nearest to the
Hebrew, for which perhaps substantial reasons will be
assigned. The Gothic bears a greater affinity to the
Greek and Roman, as being derived through the ancient
Ionic or Pelasgic, from the Phenician.</p>

<p>Lhuyd, a celebrated and profound antiquary, remarks,
Arch. Brit. page 35. "It is a common error
in etymology to endeavor the deriving all the radical
words of our western European languages from the
Latin and Greek; or indeed to derive constantly the
primitives of any one language from any particular
tongue. When we do this, we seem to forget that all
have been subject to alterations; and that the greater
and more polite any nation is, the more subject, (partly
for improvement, and partly out of a luxurious wantonness)
to new model their language. We must
therefore necessarily allow, that whatever nations were
of the neighborhood and of one common origin with
the Greeks and Latins, when they began to distinguish
themselves for politeness, they must have preserved their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
languages (which could differ from theirs only in dialects)
much better than they; and consequently no absurdity
to suppose a great many words of the language,
spoken by the old aborigines, the Osci, the L&aelig;strigones,
the Ausonians, &AElig;notrians, Umbrians and Sabines, out
of which the Latin was composed, to have been better
preserved in the Celtic than in the Roman. "Lingua
Hetrusca, Phrygia, Celtica (says the learned Stiernhelm)
affines sunt omnes; ex uno fonte derivat&aelig;. Nec
Gr&aelig;ca longe distat, Japhetic&aelig; sunt omnes; ergo et
ipsa Latina. Non igitur mirium est innumera vocabula
dictarum Linguarum communia esse cum Latinis."
And that being granted, it must also be allowed that the
Celtic (as well as all other languages) has been best preserved
by such of their colonies, as, from the situation
of their country, have been the least subject to foreign
invasions. Whence it proceeds that we always find the
ancient languages are best retained in mountains and
islands."</p>

<p>The result of this doctrine is, that the primitive Celtic
was preserved, in greatest purity, in Britain, before
the Roman and Saxon conquests, and since those periods,
in Wales and Cornwall. Hence the affinity between
the Hebrew and British, which will afterward
appear.</p>

<p>Wallis remarks that it is doubtful whether many
words in the English and German languages are derived
from the Latin, or the Latin from the Teutonic,
or whether all were derived from the same stock. "Multas
autem voces, qu&aelig; nobis cum Germanis fere sunt
communes, dubium est an prisci olim Teutones a Latinis,
an hi ab illis, aut denique utrique ab eodem commune
fonte, acceperint."&mdash;&mdash;Gram. Cap. 14.</p>

<p>But I presume that history, as well as etymology,
will go far in solving the doubt, and incline us to believe
that the Teutonic, Greek and Latin were all children
of the same parent tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>We first hear of men in the mild climate of Asia
Minor, and about the head of the Mediterranean.
Soon after the flood, the inhabitants began to migrate
into distant countries. Some of them went northward
and settled in Bactriania and Hyrcania, thence extending
westward along the shores of the Caspian sea into
Armenia. From these Asiatic colonies, sprung the
Scythians and the numerous tribes that afterwards covered
the territory of modern Russia, Sweden and Denmark.
The different tribes or hordes of these people
were called Cimbri, (perhaps from Gomer) Galli, Umbri,
&amp;c. and settled the northern parts of Europe as far
as the Rhine.</p>

<p>The northern Greek countries, Thrace and Mysia,
were peopled by the descendants of Tiras or Thiras, a
son of Japhet. The whole country from Thrace to
Peloponnesus was inhabited by the posterity of Javan and
Cittim; indeed Ionia, the ancient name of Greece,
seems to be derived from Javan, <i>J</i> or <i>I</i> being anciently
pronounced as liquid <i>i</i>, or <i>y</i> consonant, and as it is
still pronounced in the German <i>ja</i>, <i>yaw</i>. These settlements
were made long before the Pelasgic migrations
into Greece, which happened at least 2000 years before
Christ. The original language of Greece was called
<i>Ionic</i>, from <i>Javan</i> or <i>Ion</i>. The Pelasgi were probably
Phenicians; and ancient historians relate that they carried
letters into Greece; but these must have been in a
very rude state, so early after their invention;<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> nor do
we find that they were ever much used; at least no records
or inscriptions, in these characters, are mentioned
by the Greek historians.</p>

<p>Cadmus introduced the Phenician letters into
Greece 1494 years before Christ. These letters were
introduced with some difficulty, and both Cadmus and
his followers were obliged to adopt the <i>Ionic</i> or original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>Japhetic language, which was afterwards written in his
Phenician characters.</p>

<p>The Greeks, at different periods, sent colonies into
distant parts of the country. These settled in Thrace,
Macedon, on the banks of the Euxine, in Asia Minor,
in Italy, Sicily and on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
This Ionic or Japhetic language was therefore
the root of the Greek and Latin. It was also the
root of the Gothic language, spoken in the north of
Europe; and from which, after the revolution of ages,
the shocks of war, and the improvements in science, no
less than seven or eight different languages are derived.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Profane history therefore warrants us in asserting
that the Greek, Roman, and all the modern languages
of the north of Europe, and the English, among the
rest, had a common stock. But history alone would
not silence our objections to this theory, were it not incontestibly
proved by a number of radical words, common
to all, which are not yet lost in the changes of
time. Etymology therefore furnishes a demonstration
of what is related in history. When one sees the words
&#947;&#953;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#954;&#969; and &#947;&#957;&#959;&#969; in Greek, <i>nosco</i>, and anciently, <i>gnosco</i>
in Latin, and <i>know</i> in English, conveying the same idea,
he is led to suspect that one nation borrowed the word
from another. But when did the English borrow this
word? The word was used by the Saxons, long before
they could have had any knowlege of Greek or Roman
authors. It furnishes therefore a strong presumption
that all the streams came from the same fountain.
But when we examin further, and find many, perhaps
a hundred words or more, common to all these languages,
the evidence of their common origin becomes
irresistible. This in fact is the case.</p>

<p>The authors then who have labored to prove the
Greek and Latin Languages to be derived from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span><i>Celtic</i>, mistake the truth. The <i>Celtic</i> was not <i>prior</i> to
the Greek and Latin, but a branch of the <i>same stock</i>;
that is, cotemporary with those languages.</p>

<p>This Japhetic language, I take to be coeval with the
Phenician or Hebrew; and there are some Hebrew
words in the English language, which must have been
derived thro the Saxon or Teutonic. But the old
British, as I before remarked, retained the greatest affinity
to the Hebrew. The reason which appears probable,
has been already assigned; the Celts and Britons
in the west of Europe, remained, till the times of Julius
C&aelig;sar, less disturbed by wars and revolutions, than
the inhabitants of Asia, Egypt and Greece.</p>

<p>But I am inclined to believe further, that the descent
of the Britons from the first Japhetic tribes that
settled in Greece, was more direct, than thro the Gomerians
or Cimbri, who travelled northward along the
shores of the Baltic. I suspect that very ancient colonies
settled on the shores of the Mediterranean, in Italy
and Spain, and thence found their way to Gaul and
Britain, before the northern tribes arrived thro Germany
and Belgium. This would account for the affinity
between the Hebrew language and the Welsh. The
opinion however is not well supported by historical
facts, and the ancient name of the British language,
<i>Cymraeg</i>, denoting its descent from the <i>Cimbric</i> is a
weighty objection.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>It is certain however that Carthage was settled by
Phenicians, about 900 years before Christ. Greek
colonies went thither in the following century, and not
long after they settled at Marseilles in Gaul. The people
therefore on both shores of the Mediterranean were
descended from the same stock as the northern nations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<p>Accordingly we are not surprized to find some radical
words nearly the same in all the existing languages of
Europe. See Jackson's Chronological Antiquities,
vol. 3, with Lhuyd, Geblin, and others.</p>

<p>To illustrate what I have advanced, respecting the
first peopling of the world, and the derivation of most
European languages from one mother tongue, I will
here insert some remarks from Rowland's Mona Antiqua
Restaurata, p. 261, with a table of words, evidently
of Hebrew original.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>A</i> TABLE, <i>shewing the Affinity and near Resemblance,
both in Sound and Signification, of many Words of the
Ancient Languages of Europe with the Original Hebrew
Tongue</i>.</p></div>

<p>"For the better understanding of the parallels of
this following table, it is to be observed, that letters of
one and the same organ are of common use in the pronunciation
of words of different languages&mdash;as for example,
<i>M</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>V</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>P</i>, are labials: <i>T</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>S</i>, are dentals:
<i>G</i>, <i>Ch</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>K</i>, <i>C</i>, are gutturals&mdash;and therefore if
the Hebrew word or sound begins with, or is made of,
any one of the labials, any of the rest of the same organ
will answer it in the derivative languages. The
same is to be observed in using the dental and the guttural
letters. For in tracing out the origin of words,
we are more to regard the sound of them than their literal
form and composition; wherein we find words
very often, by the humors and fancy of people, transposed
and altered from their native sounds, and yet in
their signification they very well fit their original patterns.
I shall only exemplify in the letters <i>M</i>, <i>B</i>, and
<i>V</i>, which are of one organ, that is, are formed by one
instrument, the lip; and therefore are promiscuously
used the one for the other, in pronouncing words of one
language in another. The Hebrew <i>B</i> is generally pronounced
as a <i>V</i> consonant. And the Irish also, most
commonly in the middle of a word, pronounce <i>M</i> as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
<i>V</i>; as we find the ancient Britons to have made use of
<i>V</i>, or rather <i>F</i>, which they pronounce as <i>V</i>, for <i>M</i> and
<i>B</i> in many Latin words; as,</p>

<p>"We are not to wonder at this analogy of sounds in
the primitive distinction of languages. For before the
use of writing, which has established the correct form
of words, people were only guided by the ear in taking
the sound of words, and they pronounced and uttered
them again as the organs of their voice were best fitted
for it; and it happening that the aptitude and disposition
of those organs, peculiar to some people and countries,
were various (as we find to this day some nations
cannot shape their voice to express all the sounds of another's
tongue,) it accordingly affected and inclined
some parties of people to speak the same consonants
harder or softer, to utter the same vowels broader or
narrower, longer or shorter, as they found themselves
best disposed to do. And thereupon custom prevailing
with particular sets of people, to continue the use of
such different pronunciation as they affected, the words
so varied came at length to take on them different forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and to be esteemed and taken as parts of different languages,
tho in their origin they were one and the same.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Here are about fifty English words, which, from
their near resemblance to the Hebrew, both in sound
and signification, must have been borrowed from the
latter in modern ages, or been preserved thro successive
generations from Heber to the present times. But
they could not have been introduced into English in
mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>dern ages, for many of them are found in the other
branches of the Gothic, the German, Danish and
Swedish; and it can be proved that they existed in the
original Gothic or northern language. For example,
our word <i>earth</i> is found in Hebrew, and in all the dialects
of the Gothic. Hebrew, <i>ert</i> or <i>ertz</i>; Welsh,
<i>d'aira</i>; Greek, <i>éra</i>; Latin, <i>terra</i>; Gothic, <i>airthai</i>; ancient
German, <i>erth</i> or <i>herth</i>; Saxon, <i>eartho</i>; Low Dutch,
<i>aerden</i>; High Dutch, erden; Swiss, erden; Scotch, airth;
Norwegian or Norse, <i>iorden</i>; Danish, <i>iorden</i>; Swedish,
<i>iordenne</i>; Irelandic, <i>iordu</i>. In the pronunciation of
these words there is little difference, except such as is
common to the several languages. The ancients aspirated
their words more frequently than the moderns;
hence the old Germans pronounced the word with <i>h</i>, as
appears by a passage in Tacitus, De Mor. Germ. 40.
"Nec quidquam notabile in singulis, nisi quod in commune
<i>Herthum</i>, id est <i>terram</i>, matrem colunt."&mdash;The
modern nations of the north generally write and pronounce
<i>d</i> where we write <i>th</i>; as <i>erden</i>; and the <i>i</i> of the
Norwegians answers to our <i>e</i> or <i>y</i>, so that <i>iorden</i> is pronounced
<i>yorden</i>; and it is remarkable that many of the
common English people still pronounce <i>earth</i>, <i>yerth</i>.</p>

<p>The Hebrew <i>turna</i> is found in the British <i>teyrn</i>, signifying
a prince or ruler. This word is the root of the
Greek <i>turannos</i>, the Latin <i>tyrannus</i>, the British <i>dyrnas</i>, a
kingdom or jurisdiction, which is still preserved in the
modern Welsh <i>deyrnas</i>; and we see the word in the
name of the celebrated British commander, <i>Vortighern</i>.
Our word tyrant is derived from it, but it is always used
in a bad sense.</p>

<p>In the Hebrew <i>rechus</i> or <i>rekus</i>, we have the origin of
the English <i>rich</i>, <i>riches</i>, and the termination<i> rick</i>
in bishop-<i>rick</i>, and anciently, in king-<i>rick</i>; the word
originally denoting <i>landed property</i>, in which wealth was
supposed to consist, and afterwards <i>jurisdiction</i>. From
the same word are derived the Anglo Saxon <i>ryc</i>; the
Franco Theotisc, <i>rihhi</i>; the Cimbric, <i>rickie</i>; the ancient
Irish or Gaedhlig, <i>riogda</i>; the Low Dutch, <i>rijcke</i>;
the Frisic, <i>rick</i>; the German, <i>reich</i>; the Swiss, <i>rijch</i>;
the Danish, <i>rige</i>; the Norwegian, <i>riga</i>; the Swedish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
<i>ricke</i>; the French, <i>riche</i>, and the Spanish, <i>riccos</i>, a general
name for nobility, or wealthy proprietors of land.</p>

<p>The word <i>Caer</i> seems to have been a very ancient
name for a city or town. We probably see this word
in a great number of Welsh names, <i>Carmarthen</i>, <i>Carnarvon</i>,
<i>Carlisle</i>, &amp;c. This word seems also to be the
origin of <i>Cairo</i>, in Egypt; <i>Carthage</i> or town of the
horse;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the <i>cirthe</i> of the Numidians, and the <i>Caere</i> of
the Etruscan. "Inde Turnus Rutilique, diffisi rebus,
ad florentes Etruscorum opes Mezentiumque eorum
regem, confugiunt; qui <i>Caere</i>, opulento tum oppido
imperitans&mdash;haud gravatim socia arma Rutulis junxit."&mdash;Liv.
lib. 1. 2. Here we hear of the word before the
foundation of Rome.</p>

<p>But the affinity between the Hebrew and British is
much more obvious, than that between the Hebrew
and English. There are about one hundred and eighty
British words in the foregoing table, which are clearly
the same as the Hebrew; and there is no way to account
for the fact, but by supposing them to be all derived
from the same primitive tongue.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the Welsh, Latin and
English may be observed in the following.</p>

<p>The old Britons however might have borrowed these
words from the Romans, during their government of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>the Island; as the English did many of theirs at a later
period.</p>

<p>In this table, we see the different nations begin the
same word with a different consonant. The ancient
Latin <i>v</i> was pronounced as our <i>w</i>; vinum, <i>winum</i>;
hence the English <i>wine</i>. So in the following:</p>

and an anatomist will readily assign the reason. The

<p>The reader will find no difficulty in believing these
words to be from the same root, when he is told that
the Greeks and the northern nations of Europe pronounced
with a strong guttural aspirate; and that <i>k</i> among
the Greeks was often a mere aspirate, like <i>h</i>.
Thus the Romans often pronounced <i>c</i>; for which reason
that letter is often omitted, and <i>h</i> substituted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>modern English. <i>Curro</i> and <i>hurry</i> are the same word;
and so are <i>cornu</i> and <i>horn</i>; <i>Carolus</i> and <i>Harold</i>.</p>

<p>These words are incontestibly the same, with mere
dialectical variations. All are branches of the same
stock, yet neither can claim the honor of being that
stock.</p>

<p>But the most curious etymological analysis ever
exhibited perhaps in any language, is that found in
Gebelin's works. Take the following specimens.</p>

<p>In the primitive language (of Europe) the monosyllable
<i>tar</i>, <i>ter</i>, <i>tor</i> or <i>tro</i>, for it appeared under these
forms, signified <i>force</i>. It was composed of <i>t</i> and <i>ar</i> or
<i>d'ar</i>, <i>roughness</i>, <i>rapidity</i>. Hence <i>tar</i> expressed the idea
of force, with the collateral ideas of violence, rigor,
grandeur, &amp;c. From <i>tar</i> are derived, <i>taurus</i>, a bull;
<i>torrent</i>, <i>target</i>, <i>trunk</i>, <i>truncare</i>, to cut off; <i>terror</i>, <i>trepan</i>,
<i>tare</i>, <i>detriment</i>, <i>trancher</i>, to cut; <i>retrench</i>; <i>tardus</i>, <i>tardy</i>,
<i>retard</i>, <i>tergum</i>, because things heavy, that require force,
were carried upon the back; <i>intrigue</i>, for it implies
difficulties; <i>trop</i>, too much, <i>troop</i>, <i>ter</i>, <i>trois</i>, which originally
signified a multitude; for many savage nations
have names only for the three first numbers;
<i>tierce</i>, <i>tres</i>, very; <i>tresses</i>, a braid or plait of hair in three
divisions; <i>triangle</i>, <i>tribunal</i>, <i>tribe</i>, <i>attribute</i>, <i>contribute</i>, &amp;c.
<i>trident</i>, <i>trillion</i>, <i>trio</i>, <i>trinity</i>, <i>entre</i>, <i>enter</i>, taken from a
relation of three objects, <i>one</i> between <i>two</i>, makes a <i>third</i>;
hence <i>internal</i>, <i>external</i>, <i>travers</i>, across; <i>tradition</i>, passing
from one to another; <i>traffic</i>, <i>trahir</i>, to draw; <i>traitor</i>,
<i>trepidation</i>, <i>intrepid</i>. From <i>tra</i>, between, and <i>es</i>, it
is, came the Celtic, <i>treh</i>, a narrow pass, a <i>strait</i>, <i>strict</i>,
Fr. <i>etroit</i>, <i>astringent</i>, <i>detroit</i>, strait; <i>distress</i>, <i>strength</i>.
The compounds are numerous. <i>Intrinsic</i>, <i>entrails</i>, <i>introduce</i>,
<i>extraneous</i>, <i>extravagant</i>, <i>transcendent</i>, <i>transfer</i>,
<i>transform</i>, <i>transgress</i>, <i>transact</i>, <i>translate</i>, <i>transmit</i>, <i>transmigrate</i>,
<i>transmutation</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Paltroon</i> is from <i>pollex</i>, a <i>thumb</i>, and <i>truncare</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
to cut off; for cowards use to cut their thumbs to avoid
service.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">TEM</em>.</p>

<p><i>Tem</i> signified river, water. Hence <i>tempero</i> in Latin
signified to <i>plunge into water</i>. We to this day say to
<i>temper iron or steel</i>. <i>To temper</i>, is to moderate. From
this root come <i>temperance</i>, <i>temperature</i>, and a numerous
catalogue of other words. The river Thames derives
its name from the same root.</p>

<p><em class="gesperrt">VA</em>, <i>to go</i>, <i>radical</i>.</p>

<p>From <i>va</i>, the Celtic root, we find a multitude of
branches in Greek, Latin, English and French. It is
an <i>onomatope</i>, a word borrowed from the sound of our
feet in walking. Its derivatives are, <i>wade</i>, <i>evade</i>, <i>evasion</i>,
<i>invade</i>, <i>invasion</i>, <i>venio</i>, Lat. and <i>venir</i>, Fr. to come;
<i>venia</i> and <i>venial</i>,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> <i>adventure</i>, <i>avenue</i>, <i>convenio</i>, <i>convenience</i>,
<i>convention</i>, <i>covenant</i> perhaps, <i>contravene</i>, <i>intervene</i>,
<i>invent</i>, <i>prevent</i>, <i>province</i>,<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> <i>advance</i>, <i>via</i>, <i>way</i>, <i>voyage</i>, <i>convoy</i>,
<i>convey</i>, <i>obviate</i>, <i>vex</i>, <i>invective</i>, <i>vein</i>, a way for the
blood; <i>voiture</i>, Fr. for a load to carry; <i>evitare</i>, Lat.
to shun; <i>inevitable</i>.</p>

<p>To these derivatives, I will just add a comparative
view of the verbs <i>have</i> and <i>be</i> in several languages.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that <i>have</i>, in all these languages, is
from the same root. But there seem to have been
anciently two substantive verbs, or perhaps three, from
which modern nations have borrowed; viz, the Greek
&#949;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#953; or &#949;&#953;&#956;&#953;, or the Latin <i>esse</i>, from which most of the
foregoing are derived; the Teutonic <i>beon</i>, whence the
Germans have their <i>bin</i> and <i>bist</i>, and the English their
<i>be</i> and <i>beest</i>; and an old Gothic or Teutonic word, <i>weorthan</i>,
whence the Danes have derived their <i>v&oelig;rer</i>, and
the English and Germans their <i>were</i> and <i>werden</i>. In the
old English phrase, "woe <i>worth</i> the day," we see the
same verb.</p>

<p>Having stated my reasons and authorities for believing
all the European languages descended from one
parent tongue, I will here subjoin the Lord's Prayer in
several languages of Celtic and Gothic origin. The
affinity between all the branches of the Gothic is very
visible; the affinity likewise between all the branches
of the Celtic is very obvious, except the ancient Irish.
The Cantabrian and Lapland tongues have little resemblance
to either of the stocks or their branches.</p>

<p>Very little affinity is discoverable between the original
Gothic and Celtic or their derivatives; yet this is not
a proof that they were <i>ab origine</i> distinct languages; for
the words in this prayer are few, and it has been proved
that there are many words common to both those
ancient tongues.</p>

<p>[From Chamberlayn, p. 44.]</p>

<p>Here we find many of the same words, with small
variations, in all the languages of Teutonic origin. It
is however observable that the English have softened
some words, by omitting the gutturals. Thus <i>gehalgud</i>
in the Anglo-Saxon; <i>geheiliget</i> in the German;
<i>gheheylight</i> in the Belgic; and <i>geheyligt</i> in the Swiss, are
softened into <i>hallowed</i> in English; <i>taeglich</i> and <i>dagelijcht</i>
become <i>daily</i>. Similar omissions run thro the language.
Thus <i>nagel</i>, <i>hagel</i> have become in English <i>nail</i> and <i>hail</i>.
The <i>gh</i> in <i>might</i>, <i>night</i> are still pronounced by the Scotch;
but the English say <i>mite</i>, <i>nite</i>.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The affinity between the a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>ncient British, the modern
Welsh, and the Armoric, is very obvious; but in
the latter, we find a few Latin or French words&mdash;<i>pardon</i>,
<i>peichdon</i>, <i>deliur</i>, which we should naturally expect
from the vicinity of Britanny to the French language.</p>

<p>I have been at the pains to examin a great number
of radical words in the Danish, and find the most of them,
amounting to more than four hundred, very little different
from the English. Where the English write <i>w</i>, the Danes
write <i>v</i>; <i>vind</i> for <i>wind</i>. Where the English write <i>c</i> hard,
the Danes, with more judgement, write <i>k</i>; <i>klover</i>, <i>kan</i>,
<i>kommer</i>, for <i>cleave</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>come</i>. Where the English write
<i>wh</i>, the Danes, with propriety, write <i>hv</i>, <i>v</i> having the
sound of <i>w</i>; as <i>hvad</i>, <i>hvi</i>, <i>hval</i>; <i>what</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>whole</i>.</p>

<p>The words, common to the Danish and English, are
mostly monosyllables.</p>

<p>As a corroborating proof of the Eastern origin of the
Goths, authors produce the resemblance between their
religious opinions and the notions of the Magi. The
Scandinavian mythology is preserved in the EDDA,
written by Snorro Sturleson, an Icelander, a learned
judge and first magistrate in the 12th century.</p>

<p>In this there are many notions which seem to bear a
great analogy to the doctrines revealed in the Bible.</p>

<p>It is represented in the Edda, that before creation,
"all was one vast abyss;" an idea not unlike the scripture
account of what we usually call <i>chaos</i>.&mdash;"That
<i>Surtur</i>, the black, shall come at the end of the world,
vanquish the gods and give up the universe to the
flames"&mdash;a crude notion of the conflagration.&mdash;"That
<i>Ymer</i> the first man or great giant, slept and fell into a
sweat, and from the pit of his left arm were born male
and female;" this has some resemblance to the scripture
account of the creation of the woman&mdash;"That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>the sons of <i>Bore</i> slew the giant <i>Ymer</i>, and all the giants
of the frost were drowned, except Bengelmer, who was
saved in his bark;" in which notion we observe some
tradition of the deluge.</p>

<p>The opinion that the world will be destroyed by fire
seems to have been universal among the Gothic nations.
The descriptions of that catastrophe resemble
those of the Stoics and of the ancient Magi and Zoroaster,
from whom the idea was probably taken. These
descriptions all agree with the scripture representation
of that event in the material circumstances.</p>

<p>The doctrine of a future state, or of a renovation of
the world, was part of the Gothic system. It was
taught by Zamolxis, the celebrated Druid of the Get&aelig;
and Scythians.&mdash;&mdash; Herod. Lib. 4. &sect; 95.</p>

<p>In this same Edda, we also find the origin of some
customs still remaining among the descendants of the
northern nations. The drinking of bumpers is not an
invention of modern bacchanals; it is mentioned, fable
25, of the Edda, where it is said Thor challenged one
to a drinking match.</p>

<p>The custom of hanging up bushes on Christmas eve
is derived probably from the superstitious veneration
paid to the Misseltoe by the Scandinavians.</p>

<p>Indeed the festival of Christmas was grafted upon
an ancient pagan feast, celebrated at the winter solstice,
in honour of the sun and to render the new year propitious.
It answered to the Roman Saturnalia, and
was probably of as high an origin. The night on
which it was observed was called <i>Mother Night</i>, as that
which produced the rest; and the feast itself was called
by the Goths <i>Iuul</i>.&mdash;See Mallet's North. Antiq. vol.
1. p. 130. Hence the old word <i>yeul</i> or <i>yule</i> for Christmas;
a word that is still used, or at least has been used
till within a century in Scotland and the north of England.
"Yule," says that learned antiquary, Cowel, "in
the north parts of England, is used by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>country people
as the name of the feast of our Lord's nativity, usually
termed <i>Christmas</i>. The sports used at Christmas,
called Christmas Gamboles, they stile <i>Yule Games</i>.
<i>Yule</i> is the proper Scotch word for Christmas."&mdash;&mdash;Cowel's
Law Dictionary, tit. Yule. The Parliament
passed an act for discharging the <i>Yule Vacance</i>, which
was repealed after the union by stat. George I. cap. 8.
The feast was celebrated from time immemorial among
the Romans and Goths; the Christians changed its
object and name; tho such is the force of custom, that
the Gothic name existed in Scotland till lately, and
perhaps still exists among the lower ranks of people.</p>

<p>From the northern nations also we have the names
of the days of the week; or at least of some of them.
The ancient Goths devoted particular days to particular
deities.</p>

<p>TUESDAY was <i>Tyrsdag</i>, from Tyr the God of
bravery. It is in the Danish, <i>Tyrsdag</i>, and in the Swedish
<i>Tisdag</i>.</p>

<p>WEDNESDAY is <i>Woden'sdag</i>, from <i>Woden</i>, a celebrated
warrior deified. In Icelandic, it is <i>Wonsdag</i>; in
Swedish, <i>Odinsdag</i>; in Dutch, <i>Woensdag</i>; in Anglo
Saxon, <i>Wodensdag</i>.</p>

<p>THURSDAY is from <i>Thor</i>, god of the air. In
Danish it is <i>Thorsdag</i>; in Swedish <i>Torsdag</i>.</p>

<p>FRIDAY is from <i>Frea</i>, the earth and goddess of
love, answering to the Venus of the Greeks. In some
languages it is called <i>Freytag</i>.&mdash;&mdash; See Mallet's North.
Antiquities.</p>

<p>I will just add, it is a weighty argument in favor of
the truth of the Scripture history, and of the opinion
here advanced of the common origin of languages, that
in all the ancient and modern European alphabets, the
letters are of a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> figure and power, and arranged
nearly in the same order.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The true Greek letters
were only the Cadmean letters reversed: This reversal
took place early in Greece, when the ancient Phenician
and Hebrew order of writing from right to left, was
changed for the modern order, which is from left to
right. The Hebrew or Phenician Alphabet was clearly
the parent of the Greek, Roman and Gothic.</p>

<p>The reader will please to accept the following
specimen, which will convey an idea of the whole.</p>

<p><i>Punic.</i></p>

sicorathissi
me com
syth chim lach
chunyth mum
ys tyal myethi
barii im
schi.</p>

<p>Iath all o

sith chimi lach
chuinigh! muini

<p><i>English.</i></p>

<p>Omnipotent,
much dreaded Deity
of this country! asswage
my troubled
mind! Thou, the
support of feeble captives!
being now exhausted
with fatigue,
of thy free will, guide
me to my children.</p>

<p>In this example the affinity between the Punic and
Irish is striking; and the same runs thro the whole
speech.</p>

<p>That Ireland received colonies from Spain or Carthage
is probable from other circumstances. The Irish
historians say their ancestors received letters from
the Phenicians; and the Irish language was called
<i>Bearni Feni</i>, the Phenician tongue. <i>Cadiz</i> in Spain
was first settled by Phenicians; and <i>cadas</i> in Irish signifies
<i>friendship</i>.</p>

<p>The Irish seems to be a compound of <i>Celtic</i> and <i>Punic</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>and if Ireland was peopled originally from Carthage,
and received colonies from thence, the event
must have been subsequent to the first Punic war; for
this was the period when the Carthaginians adopted
the Roman letters, and there is no inscription in Ireland
in the Phenician character.</p>

<p>The Hebrew was the root of the Phenician and the
Punic. The Maltese is evidently a branch of the Punic;
for it approaches nearer to the Hebrew and Chaldaic,
than to the Arabic. For this assertion we have the
authority of <i>M. Maius</i>, professor of the Greek and oriental
languages in the Ludovician university of Giessen,
who had his accounts from <i>Ribier</i>, a missionary
Jesuit and native of Malta. This fact will account for
the correspondence between the Irish and the Maltese,
in several particulars. In Maltese, <i>Alla</i> signifies <i>God</i>;
in Irish, <i>All</i> is <i>mighty</i>. <i>Baol</i> in Maltese, and <i>Bel</i> or <i>Bal</i>
in Irish, signify <i>Chief Deity</i> or <i>Sun</i>. In Maltese, <i>ordu</i>
is <i>end</i> or <i>summit</i>; in Irish, <i>ard</i>, <i>arda</i>, are <i>hill</i>, <i>high</i>.
These words are probably from the same root as the
Latin <i>arduus</i>, and the English <i>hard</i>, implying labor.
<i>Bandla</i> in Maltese, is <i>a cord</i>; in Irish, <i>bann</i> is suspension.
In Maltese, <i>gala</i> is the sail of a ship; and in Irish,
<i>gal</i> is a gale of wind. These Maltese words are
taken from a Punica Maltese Dictionary, annexed to a
treatise, Della lingua Punica presentamente usitate da
Maltese, by G. Pietro Francisco Agius de Solandas.</p>

<p>There is also a correspondence between the Irish
and Punic, in the variation of their nouns, as may be
observed in the following example.</p>

<p>In several particulars the Irish bears a close affinity
to the Hebrew and Greek. It was the custom with
the Hebrews, and it still remains with them, to face the
east in the act of devotion. From this practice it proceeded,
that the same word which signified <i>right hand</i>,
signified also <i>south</i>; the same with <i>left hand</i> and <i>north</i>;
<i>before</i> and <i>east</i>; <i>behind</i> and <i>west</i>. This is the case also
in the Irish language.</p>

<p>That the Greeks had an intercourse with the islands
of Britain and Ireland, or sent colonies thither, is not
impossible; and Dr. Todd, not many years ago, discovered,
at Colchester, in Essex, an altar dedicated to the
Tyrian Hercules, with an inscription in Greek capitals,</p>

<p>&#919;&#929;&#913;&#922;&#923;&#919;&#931; &#932;&#933;&#929;&#917;&#927; &#916;&#917;&#921;&#927; &#916;&#927;&#922;&#913; &#913;&#929;&#935;&#921;&#917;&#929;&#921;&#913;.</p>

<p>There is a place in Ireland called <i>Airchil</i>. And it
is a remarkable fact, that some fragments of old Irish
laws, which, for a long time, puzzled the antiquaries
of the nation, are found to be written in a very ancient
language, and in the manner which the Greeks called
<i>Boustrophedon</i>; that is, from right to left, and from left
to right, in the manner that oxen plow. This was
supposed to be an improvement on the Hebrew and
Phenician order of writing all the lines from right to
left, which Cadmus introduced into Greece. This
manner of writing in Greece was prior to Homer, and
if the Irish copied from the Greeks, which is not impossible,
the fact would prove a very early settlement of
Ireland by Greek colonies or their descendants. See
Leland's Hist. of Ireland, Prelim. Dis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>
<p>All these circumstances corroborate the opinion that
the Celts came originally from the east, and formed settlements
on the shores of the Mediterranean and Atlantic.
The affinity between the Phenician, the Punic,
the Maltese, the Irish and the British languages, discoverable
in a great number of words, makes it probable,
that after colonies were settled at Carthage and at
Cadiz, some commercial intercourse was carried on between
them and the nations at the head of the Mediterranean,
and that an emigration from Spain might
people Ireland before any settlements had been made
there by the Gauls or Britons. It is however more
probable that the Punic words in the Irish language
might have been introduced into that island by subsequent
colonization. At any rate, from the Hebrew,
Chaldaic, or Phenician, or the common root of these
languages, proceeded the Punic, the Maltese, the Iberian
or Spanish, the Gaulish, the British, and the Irish.
The order I have mentioned is obvious and natural;
and history furnishes us with some facts to strengthen
the supposition.</p>

<p>Bishop Hickes, in his Saxon Grammar, which is a
vast treasure of valuable learning, has preserved a specimen
of the language and of the opinions of the English
respecting it, in an extract from a manuscript of
one Ranulphus Higdenus, <i>de Incolarum linguis</i>, translated
by John Trevisa in 1385, and the ninth of Richard
II. Trevisa's stile bears some affinity to that of Chaucer,
with whom he was cotemporary.</p>

<p>On this passage we may make the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. That the third person singular of the verb is invariably
used with <i>plural</i> as well as singular nouns; <i>they</i>
<i>beeth</i>, <i>haveth</i>. Whereas in Chaucer and Mandeville
the same person ends generally in <i>en</i>; <i>they seyn</i> for <i>they
say</i>.</p></div>

<p>The same third person was used for the imperative,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2. That <i>yif</i> is used for <i>if</i>; a proof that <i>if</i> is a verb,

<p>3. That the subjunctive form of verbs was not used
after <i>if</i>; <i>and yif they goeth to the northe contray</i>.</p>

<p>4. That there were three principal dialects in the
English; the <i>northern</i>, which was corrupted by the Scots
and Picts, and from which the present Yorkshire language
is derived; the <i>middle</i>, which came from Germany
and retained its primitive purity, and is the true
parent of modern English; and the <i>southern</i>, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>is meant, either the language of the southern parts
which was corrupted by an intercourse with foreigners;
or what is more probable, the language spoken in Devonshire,
and on the borders of Cornwall, which was
mixed with the old British, and is now almost unintelligible.</p>

<p>5. That the conquests of the Danes and Normans
had corrupted the pure language of the Saxons.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>6. That this corruption proceeded principally from
the teaching of French in schools.</p>

do now, <i>to be told of</i>.</p>

<p>Chaucer's merit in improving the English language

the <i>fader in science</i>, and the <i>firste fynder of our
fayre langage</i>.</p>

<p>He died in 1400.</p>

<p>It must however be remarked that Chaucer did not
import foreign words, so much as introduce them into
books and give them currency in writing. It must further
be observed that when I speak of the incorporation
of Latin words with the English, I would not be understood
to mean that words were taken directly from the
Roman tongue and anglicised. On the other hand,
they mostly came thro the channel of the Norman or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Proven&ccedil;al French; and perhaps we may call them
with propriety <i>French</i> words; for they had lost much
of their Roman form among the Gauls, Franks and
Normans.</p>

<p>The most correct account I have seen of the state of
the language in the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th centuries,
is in the first volume of Bell's edition of Chaucer.</p>

<p>We have the authority of Ingulphus, a historian of
credit, for alleging that the French began to be fashionable
in England, before the conquest. Edward the
Confessor resided many years in Normandy, and imbibed
a predilection for the French manners and language.
On his accession to the throne of England, in
1043, he promoted many of his Norman favorites to
the first dignities in the kingdom; under the influence
of the king and his friends, the English began to imitate
the French fashions.</p>

<p>But the conquest in 1066, completed the change.
The court of William consisted principally of foreigners
who could speak no language but French. Most of the
high offices and rich livings in the kingdom were filled
with Normans, and the castles which, by order of the
conqueror, were built in different parts of the country,
were garrisoned by foreign soldiers, in whom the king
might most safely confide.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Public business was transacted
in the French, and it became dishonorable or a
mark of low breeding, not to understand that language.
Indeed under the first reigns after the conquest, it was
a disgrace to be called an <i>Englishman</i>. In this depressed
state of the English, their language could not fail to be
neglected by the polite part of the nation.</p>

<p>But as the body of the nation did not understand
French, there must have been a constant effort to root
it out and establish the English. The latter however
gained ground slowly during the two first centuries of
the revolution. But in the reign of king John, Normandy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
which had been united with England under the
Norman princes, was taken by the French, 1205, and
thus separated from the British dominions. In the
next reign (Henry III.) some regulations were made
between the two kingdoms, by which the subjects of either
were rendered incapable of holding lands in the
other. These events must have restrained, in some
degree, the intercourse between the two kingdoms, and
given the English an opportunity to assume their own
native character and importance. In this reign the
English began to value themselves upon their birth, and
a knowlege of the English language was a recommendation,
tho not a requisite, in a candidate for a benefice.</p>

<p>It appears also by the passage of Higden before quoted,
that the practice of construing Latin into French,
in the schools, had closed before his time. This, with
the other causes before assigned, contributed to root out
the French, and make the English reputable; and in
the reign of Edward III. produced the act, mentioned
in the text, in favor of the English. This act did not
produce a total change of practice at once; for we find
the proceedings in parliament were published in French
for sixty years after the pleas in courts were ordered to
be in English, and the statutes continued in French about
120 years after the act, till the first of Richard III.</p>

<p>It may be observed that the royal assent to bills was
in some instances given in English during the reign of
Henry VI. <i>Be it ordained as it is asked: Be it as it is
axed.</i><a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> But the royal assent is now declared in French.</p>

<p>Sir William Temple's stile, tho easy and flowing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>is too diffuse: Every page of his abounds with tautologies.
Take the following specimen from the first
page that presents itself on opening his third volume.</p>

<p>"Upon the survey of these dispositions in mankind
and these conditions of government, it seems much
more reasonable to pity than to envy the <i>fortunes</i> and
<i>dignities</i> of princes or <i>great</i> ministers of <i>state</i>; and to
<i>lessen</i> and <i>excuse</i> their <i>venial</i> faults, or at least their misfortunes,
rather than to <i>encrease</i> and <i>make them worse</i> by
<i>ill colors</i> and <i>representations</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Of Pop. Dis.</p>

<p><i>Fortunes</i> and <i>dignities</i> might have been better
expressed by <i>elevated rank</i> or <i>high stations</i>; <i>great</i> is superfluous,
and so are <i>lessen</i> and <i>make them worse</i>, and either
<i>colors</i> or <i>representations</i> might have been omitted.</p>

<p>"The first safety of <i>princes</i> and <i>states</i> lies in avoiding
all <i>councils</i> or <i>designs</i> of innovation, in <i>ancient</i> and <i>established
forms</i> and <i>laws</i>, especially those concerning liberty,
property and religion (which are the possessions men
will ever have most at heart;) and thereby leaving the
channel of <i>known</i> and <i>common</i> justice <i>clear</i> and <i>undisturbed</i>."
Several words might here be retrenched, and
yet leave the author's meaning more precise and intelligible.
This is the principal fault in Temple's stile.</p>

<p>"But men, accustomed to the free and vagrant life
of hunters, are incapable of regular application to labor;
and consider agriculture as a <i>secondary</i> and <i>inferior</i>
occupation."&mdash;Robertson's Hist. Amer. book 4.</p>

<p>Supposing <i>secondary</i> and <i>inferior</i> not to be exactly
synonimous, in this sentence one would have answered
the purpose.</p>

<p>"<i>Agriculture</i>, even when the strength of man
is seconded by that of the animals <i>which he has subjected
to the yoke</i>, and his power augmented by <i>the use of the
various instruments with which</i> the discovery of metals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>has furnished him, is still <i>a work</i> of great labor."&mdash;The
same.</p>

<p>This sentence is very exceptionable. Is <i>agriculture,
a work?</i> Can so <i>definite</i> a term be applied to such a
<i>general</i> idea? But what a group of useless words follow!
It was not sufficient to say, <i>the strength of man seconded
by that of animals</i>, but the kinds of animals must be specified;
viz. such as <i>he has subjected to the yoke</i>; when
every person knows that other animals are never used;
and consequently the author's idea would have been
sufficiently explicit without that specification. In the
subsequent clause, the words, <i>his power augmented by the
use of the various instruments of metal</i>, would have been
explicit; for the <i>discovery of metals</i> must have been implied.
Such expletive words load the mind with a
chain of particular ideas which are not essential to the
discourse.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And if any one of these prognostics is deemed
unfavorable, they instantly abandon the pursuit of <i>those</i>
measures, <i>on which they are most eagerly bent</i>."&mdash;The
same.</p>

<p>Here is an awkward conclusion of the period, and
ascribeable to a too nice regard for grammatical rules.
<i>They are most eagerly bent on</i>, would perhaps have been
better; but a different construction would have been
still less exceptionable. There is however a greater
fault in the construction. By employing <i>those</i> and
<i>most eagerly</i>, the idea is, that savages, on the appearance
of unfavorable omens, would abandon <i>those</i> measures
<i>only</i>, on which they are <i>most eagerly</i> bent, and not others
that they might be pursuing with less earnestness.
Why could not the author have said in plain English&mdash;"they
instantly abandon any measure they are pursuing."</p>

<p>This writer's stile likewise abounds with synonims;
as <i>strengthen</i> and <i>confirm</i>, <i>quicken</i> and <i>animate</i>; when
one term would fully express the meaning. "Strong
liquors <i>awake</i> a savage from his <i>torpid state</i>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span><i>give a
brisker motion to his spirits</i>, and <i>enliven</i> him more thoroughly
than either dancing or gaming."&mdash;Book. 4.
What a needless repetition of the same idea! The author
is also very liberal in the use of <i>all</i>&mdash;"<i>all</i> the
<i>transports</i> and <i>frenzy</i> of intoxication."&mdash;"War, which
between extensive kingdoms, is carried on with little animosity,
is prosecuted by small tribes, with <i>all</i> the rancor
of a private quarrel."</p>

<p>In short, the stile of Dr. Robertson, the great, the
philosophic historian, is too labored. The mind of the
reader is kept constantly engaged in attending to the
structure of the periods; it is fatigued with words and
drawn from the chain of events.</p>

<p>The stile of Kaims, tho not easy and flowing, is
precise, and generally accurate. The stile of Blair's
Lectures is less correct than that of his Sermons; but
at the same time, less formal in the structure of the periods.</p>

<p>These remarks, the reader will observe, respect stile
only; for the merit of Robertson, as a judicious and
faithful historian; and of Kaims and Blair, as critics,
is above praise or censure.</p>

<p>In no particular is the false taste of the English more
obvious, than in the promiscuous encomiums they have
bestowed on Gibbon, as a historian. His work is
not properly a "<i>History</i> of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire;" but a "Poetico-Historical Description
of certain Persons and Events, embellished with
suitable imagery and episodes, designed to show the author's
talent in selecting words, as well as to delight
the ears of his readers." In short, his history should
be entitled, "A Display of Words;" except some
chapters which are excellent commentaries on the
history of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>
<p>The general fault of this author is, he takes more
pains to form his sentences, than to collect, arrange and
express the facts in an easy and perspicuous manner.
In consequence of attending to ornament, he seems to
forget that he is writing for the <i>information</i> of his reader,
and when he ought to <i>instruct</i> the <i>mind</i>, he is only
<i>pleasing</i> the <i>ear</i>. Fully possessed of his subject, he describes
things and events in general terms or figurative
language, which leave upon the mind a faint evanescent
impression of some indeterminate idea; so that the
reader, not obtaining a clear precise knowlege of the
facts, finds it difficult to understand, and impossible to
recollect, the author's meaning. Let a man read his
volumes with the most laborious attention, and he will
find at the close that he can give very little account of
the "Roman Empire;" but he will remember perfectly
that Gibbon is a most elegant writer.</p>

<p>History is capable of very little embellishment;
<i>tropes</i> and <i>figures</i> are the proper instruments of <i>eloquence</i>
and <i>declamation</i>; <i>facts</i> only are the subjects of <i>history</i>.
Reflections of the author are admitted; but these should
not be frequent; for the reader claims a right to his
own opinions. The justness of the historian's remarks
may be called in question&mdash;facts only are incontestible.
The plain narrative of the Scripture historians, and of
Herodotus, with their dialogues and digressions, is as
far superior, considered as pure history, to the affected
glaring brilliancy of stile and manner, which runs thro
Gibbon's writings, as truth is to fiction; or the vermillion
blush of nature and innocence, to the artificial
daubings of fashion. The first never fails to affect the
heart&mdash;the last can only dazzle the senses.</p>

<p>Another fault in Gibbon's manner of writing, is,
the use of <i>epithets</i> or <i>titles</i> instead of <i>names</i>. "The C&aelig;sar,
the conqueror of the east, the protector of the church,
the country of the C&aelig;sars, the son of Leda," and innumerable
similar appellations are employed, instead of the
real names of the persons and places; and frequently
at such a distance from any mention of the name, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the reader is obliged to turn over a leaf and look for an
explanation. Many of the epithets are new; custom
has not made us familiar with them; they have never
been substituted, by common consent, for the true names;
the reader is therefore surprized with unexpected appellations,
and constantly interrupted to find the persons
or things to which they belong.</p>

<p>I am not about to write a lengthy criticism on this
author's history; a few passages only will be selected
as proofs of what I have advanced. "Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire," vol. 3, oct. chap. 17: In
explaining the motives of the Emperors for removing the
seat of government from Rome to the East, the author
says&mdash;"<i>Rome</i> was insensibly confounded with the dependent
kingdoms which had once acknowleged her
supremacy; and <i>the country of the C&aelig;sars</i> was viewed
with cold indifference by a martial prince, born in the
neighborhood of the Danube, educated in the courts
and armies of Asia, and invested with the <i>purple</i> by the
legions of Britain." By the author's beginning one
part of the sentence with <i>Rome</i>, and the other with <i>the
country of the C&aelig;sars</i>, the reader is led to think two different
places are intended, for he has not a suspicion of
a tautology; or at least he supposes the author uses <i>the
country of the C&aelig;sars</i> in a more extensive sense than
<i>Rome</i>. He therefore looks back and reads perhaps half
a page with a closer attention, and finds that the writer
is speaking of the <i>seat of empire</i>, and therefore can mean
the <i>city of Rome</i> only. After this trouble he is displeased
that the author has employed <i>five words</i> to swell and
adorn his period. This however is not the only difficulty
in understanding the author. Who is the <i>martial
prince</i>? In the preceding sentence, Dioclesian is mentioned,
as withdrawing from Rome; and in the sentence
following, Constantine is said to visit Rome but seldom.
The reader then is left to collect the author's meaning,
by the circumstances of the birth, education and election
of this martial prince. If he is possessed of these
facts already, he may go on without much trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>The author's affectation of using <i>the purple</i> for the
crown or imperial dignity, is so obvious by numberless
repetitions of the word, as to be perfectly ridiculous.</p>

<p>"In the choice of an advantageous situation, he preferred
the confines of Europe and Asia; to curb, <i>with a
powerful arm</i>, the barbarians who dwelt between the
Danube and Tanais; to watch, <i>with an eye of jealousy</i>,
the conduct of the Persian monarch." Here the members
of the sentence in Italics, are altogether superfluous;
the author wanted to inform his reader, that Dioclesian
designed to curb the barbarians and watch the
Persian monarch; for which purpose he chose a favorable
situation; but it was wholly immaterial to the
subject to relate in what manner or degree, the emperor
meant to exert his arm or his jealousy. Nay more,
these are circumstances which are not reduceable to any
certainty, and of which the writer and the reader can
have no precise idea.</p>

<p>"With these views, Dioclesian had selected and
embellished the <i>residence of Nicomedia</i>."&mdash;Is Nicomedia
a princess, whose residence the emperor selected and
embellished? This is the most obvious meaning of the
sentence. But Nicomedia, we learn from other passages,
was a city, the <i>residence</i> itself of the emperor. Yet
the author could not tell us this in a few plain words,
without spoiling the harmony of the phrase; he chose
therefore to leave it obscure and ungrammatical.</p>

<p>"&mdash;But the memory of Dioclesian was justly abhorred
by the <i>Protector of the Church</i>; and <i>Constantine</i> was
not insensible to the ambition of founding a city, which
might perpetuate the glory of his own name." Who
is the <i>protector of the church</i>? By Constantine's being
mentioned immediately after, one would think he cannot
be the person intended; yet on examination, this
is found to be the case. But why this separate appellation?
It seems the author meant by it to convey this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
idea; That Dioclesian was a persecutor of the church,
therefore his memory was abhorred by Constantine who
was its protector; the <i>cause</i> of <i>Constantine</i>'s <i>abhorrence</i>
is implied, and meant to be unfolded to the reader, in
a single epithet. Is this history? I must have the liberty
to think that such <i>terseness</i> of stile, notwithstanding
the authorities of Tacitus and Gibbon, is a gross corruption
and a capital fault.</p>

<p>In description, our author often indulges a figurative
poetical manner, highly improper.</p>

<p>"The figure of the imperial city (Constantinople)
may be represented under that of an unequal triangle.
The obtuse point, which advances towards the east,
and the shores of Asia, meets and repels the waves of
the Thracian Bosphorus." Here the author soars on
poetic wings, and we behold the <i>obtuse point</i> of a <i>triangle</i>,
<i>marching</i> eastward, <i>attacking</i> and <i>repulsing</i> its <i>foes</i>, the
<i>waves</i> of the Bosphorus; in the next line, the author
sinks from the heights of Parnassus, and creeps on the
plain of <i>simple narrative</i>&mdash;"The northern side of the city
is bounded by the harbor."</p>

<p>"On these banks, tradition long preserved the memory
of the sylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the <i>son
of Leda</i> to the combat of the Cestus." The author
takes it for granted that his reader is acquainted with all
the ancient fables of Greece and Rome. Such <i>allusions</i>
to facts or fables make a wretched figure in <i>sober history</i>.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The author, after the manner of the poets, admits
episodes into his descriptions, by way of variety and
embellishment. He begins a description of Constantinople;
to do justice to the city, he must describe its situation;
he therefore gives an account of the Thracian
Bosphorus, the Propontus and Hellespont, interspersed
with ancient fables, and adorned with poetical imagery.
When he arrives at the mouth of the Hellespont, his
fancy leads him to the seat of ancient Troy, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
cannot pass it, without telling us from Homer, where
the Grecian armies were encamped; where the flanks
of the army were guarded by Agamemnon's bravest
chiefs; where Achilles and his myrmidons occupied
a promontory; where Ajax pitched his tent;
and where his tomb was erected after his death. After
indulging his fancy on this memorable field of heroic
actions, he is <i>qualified</i> to describe Constantinople.</p>

<p>But it is needless to multiply examples; for similar
faults occur in almost every page. Most men, who
have read this history, perceive a difficulty in understanding
it; yet few have attempted to find the reason;
and hardly a man has dared to censure the stile and
manner.</p>

<p>To what cause then shall we ascribe the almost unanimous
consent of the English and Americans, in
lavishing praises upon Gibbon's history? In some measure
doubtless to the greatness of the attempt, and the
want of an English history which should unfold the series
of events which connects ancient and modern times.
The man who should light a lamp, to illuminate the
dark period of time from the 5th to the 15th century,
would deserve immortal honors. The attempt is great;
it is noble; it is meritorious. Gibbon appears to have
been faithful, laborious, and perhaps impartial. It is
his stile and manner only I am censuring; for these
are exceedingly faulty. For proof of this I appeal to
a single fact, which I have never heard contradicted;
that a man who would comprehend Gibbon, must read
with painful attention, and after all receive little improvement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>
<p>The encomiums of his countrymen proceed from
false taste; a taste for superfluous ornament. Men
are disposed to lessen the trouble of reading, and to spare
the labor of examining into the causes and consequences
of events. They choose to please their eyes and ears,
rather than feed the mind. Hence the rage for <i>abridgements</i>,
and a display of rhetorical embellishments.
Hence the eclat with which "Millot's Elements of
General History," is received in the world. This
work is no more than an <i>Index to General History</i>; or
a recapitulation of the principal events. It is calculated
for two classes of people; for those who, having
read history in the original writers, want to revise their
studies, without a repetition of their first labors; and
for those who have but little time to employ in reading,
and expect only a general and superficial knowlege
of history.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> But a man who would know the minute
springs of action; the remote and collateral, as
well as the direct causes and consequences of events;
and the nice shades of character which distinguish eminent
men, with a view to draw rules from living examples;
such a man must pass by abridgements as
trash; he must have recourse to the original writers, or
to collections of authentic papers. Indeed a collection of
all the material official papers, arranged in the order of
time, however dry and unentertaining to most readers,
is really the <i>best</i>, and the <i>only authentic</i> history of a country.
The philosopher and statesman, who wish to substitute
fact for opinion, will generally suspect human
testimony; but repose full confidence in the evidence
of papers, which have been the original instruments of
public transactions, and recorded by public authority.</p>

<p>These strictures are contrary to the opinions of
most men, especially as they regard the stile of the authors
mentioned. Yet they are written with a full
conviction of their being well founded. They proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>from an earnest desire of arresting the progress of
false taste in writing, and of seeing my countrymen
called back to nature and truth.</p>


<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>The foregoing remarks were written before I had
seen the opinions of that judicious and elegant writer,
East Apthorp, <span class="smcap">M. A.</span> vicar of Croydon, on the same
history. The following passage is too directly in point
to be omitted. It is in his "Second Letter on the
Study of History."</p>

<p>"I was disappointed in my expectations of instruction
from this book (Gibbon's History) when I discerned
that the author had adopted that entertaining
but superficial manner of writing history, which was
first introduced by the Abbe de Vertot, whose History
of the Revolutions in the Government of the Roman
Republic, is one of those agreeable and seducing models
which never fail of producing a multitude of imitations.
There is, in this way of writing, merit enough
to recommend it to such readers, and such writers, as
propose to themselves no higher aim, than an elegant
literary amusement: It piques their curiosity, while it
gratifies their indolence. The historian has the advantage,
in this way, of passing over such events and institutions
as, however essential to the science of history,
are less adapted to shine in the recital. By suppressing
facts and violating chronology; by selecting the most
pleasing incidents and placing them in a striking point
of view, by the coloring and drapery of stile and composition,
the imagination is gratified with a gaudy
spectacle of triumphs and revolutions passing in review
before it; while the rapid succession of great events
affords a transient delight, without leaving useful and
lasting impressions either on the memory or judgement;
or fixing those principles which ought to be
the result of historic information.</p>

<p>"Nor is it the worst consequence of this slight an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>d
modish way of compiling history, that it affords to supine
and unreflecting readers a barren entertainment,
to fill up the vacant hours of indolence and dissipation.
The historian who gives himself the privilege of mutilating
and selecting, and arranging at discretion the records
of past ages, has full scope to obtrude on his careless
readers any system that suits with his preconceived
opinions or particular views in writing."&mdash;"The only
legitimate study of history is in <i>original historians</i>."</p>

<p>The same writer complains of a decline of literature
in Great Britain, fixing the "settlement that followed
the revolution," as the era of true science and greatness.
He remarks that the "aim of modern writers
seems to be to furnish their readers with fugitive amusement,
and that ancient literature is become rather the
ornament of our libraries, than the accomplishment of
our minds; being supplanted by the modish productions
which are daily read and forgotten."</p>

<p>For proof of what I have advanced respecting the
sound of c in Rome, I would observe, that the genitive
case of the first declension in Latin anciently ended in
<i>ai</i>, which was probably copied from the Greeks; for
it is very evident the Latin <i>&aelig;</i> in later writers, was the
true representative of the Greek <i>ai</i>. Thus <i>Mousai</i> in
Greek was translated into the Roman tongue, <i>mus&aelig;</i>.
Now <i>c</i> before <i>ai</i> had the sound of <i>k</i>; for where the
Romans wrote <i>c&aelig;</i> the Greeks wrote <i>kai</i>. Thus <i>musica</i>,
<i>music&aelig;</i> in the first declension must have been pronounced
<i>musika</i>, <i>musikai</i>, not <i>musisee</i>, as we now pronounce
the <i>&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>As a further proof, we may appeal to the laws of the
Roman poetry, by which dipthongs were always long,
having the sound of two vowels combined.</p>

<p>But a decisive proof that <i>c</i> before the vowels <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>
and the dipthongs, had the power of <i>k</i>, is that the
Greeks always translated the <i>c</i> in <i>kappa</i>. They wrote
C&aelig;sar, <i>Kaisaros</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In confirmation of which I may add, that the Germans,
among whom the word <i>C&aelig;sar</i> became common
to all emperors, and now signifies <i>emperor</i>, spell it <i>Kaisar</i>;
and in the pronunciation they preserve the true
Roman sound of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>That the Roman <i>c</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> had the force of
<i>ch</i> or <i>tsh</i>, is probable from the present practice of the
Italians, who would be the most likely to retain the
pure Roman pronunciation. In modern Italian <i>ce</i>, <i>ci</i>
are pronounced <i>che</i>, <i>chi</i>; as <i>dolcemente</i>, <i>Cicero</i>, pronounced
<i>dolchemente</i>, <i>Chichero</i>.</p>

<p>In this opinion I am supported by Dr. Middleton,
who seems to have been thoroughly versed in Roman
literature. It may gratify the learned reader to see his
own words. <i>De Lat. Liter. pron. differ.</i></p>

<p>"Ante vocales <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>v</i><a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> eundem olim sonum habuisse
ac hodie habet certissimum est: qualem autem ante
reliquas <i>e</i> et <i>i</i>, diphthongosque <i>&aelig;</i>, <i>&oelig;</i>, <i>ev</i> habuerit, haud
ita convenit. Angli illam Gallique etiam, haud ab <i>s</i>
distinguunt, in C&oelig;na, C&aelig;sar, Ceres, cinis, &amp;c. at in
iisdem Itali, quod Romanos etiam fecisse olim existimo,
eum huic liter&aelig; sonum tribuunt, quo nos <i>ch</i> efferimus,
in vocibus nostris, <i>cheek</i>, <i>cherry</i>, <i>cheap</i>, &amp;c. itaque pronunciant
Cicero, uti nos Chichester, chicheley, &amp;c. ita
tamen ac si ante <i>c</i>, cum in medio vocis sequatur vocalem,
litera t leviter admodum et subobscure sonanda
interponeretur; ut <i>Citcero</i>, Chitchester, quam pronuntiandi
rationem expressisse plane sculptor quidam videtur,
qui in inscriptione veteri contra orthographi&aelig; regulas,
<i>t</i> ante <i>c</i> interposuit in nomine <i>Vrbitcius</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>He observes however that Lipsius ridicules this opinion,
and contends that <i>c</i> had in all cases the force of
<i>k</i>. This the Doctor ascribes to his partiality for the
pronunciation of his countrymen, the Germans, which,
he says, has often led him into errors. For altho <i>k</i>
before <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i> used frequently to be written for <i>c</i>, as
<i>Karcer</i> for <i>Carcer</i>, yet it never took the place of <i>c</i> before
<i>e</i> and <i>i</i>; we never find <i>Karker</i> for <i>Carcer</i>.</p>

<p>But that <i>c</i> had the sound of our <i>ch</i>, is probable from
another fact: In old inscriptions it is found that <i>c</i> was
often used for <i>t</i> before <i>i</i>; <i>condicio</i> for <i>conditio</i>, <i>palacium</i> for
<i>palatium</i>. Now <i>ch</i> in English have a compound sound,
which begins with that of <i>t</i>, and hence <i>ti</i> and <i>ci</i> in English
have taken the sound of <i>ch</i> or <i>sh</i>. It is evident therefore
that <i>c</i> before <i>i</i> had a great affinity to <i>ti</i>; an affinity
which is still preserved in the Italian language. These
circumstances give us reason to believe that <i>ci</i> and <i>ti</i> in
<i>condicio</i> and <i>palatium</i>, were both pronounced <i>chi</i>, <i>condichio</i>,
<i>palachium</i>. This sound of <i>ci</i> agrees perfectly well
with the Saxon sound in <i>cild</i>, pronounced <i>child</i>; <i>cele</i>,
now pronounced <i>chill</i>, as I have remarked above; text,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall not enter into a particular discussion of
the question, whether <i>h</i> is a mark of <i>sound</i> or not. By
its convertibility with <i>k</i> and <i>c</i> in the ancient languages,
we have reason to conclude that it once had a guttural
sound, and the pronunciation of some northern nations
of Europe confirms the opinion. But it appears in
modern English to have no sound by itself; it however
affects, in some degree, the sound of the vowel to which
it is prefixed, by previously opening the mouth wider
than is necessary to articulate the vowel. Thus in
<i>hand</i> we hear no sound but of <i>and</i>; yet in pronouncing
<i>hand</i> we open the throat wider, and emit the breath
with violence before we begin the sound, which makes
an obvious difference in pronouncing the words <i>and</i>
and <i>hand</i>; and perhaps this distinction is perceiveable
as far as the words can be heard. The same may be
said of <i>th</i> in <i>think</i>.</p>

<p>The instance of a man who lost a dinner by telling
his servant to <i>eat</i> it, when he meant to tell him to <i>heat</i>
it, affords a useful lesson to those who are disposed to
treat the letter <i>h</i> with too much neglect.</p>

<p>That <i>i</i> short is the same sound as <i>ee</i> we have the
authority of one of the first and best English grammarians.
"Hunc sonum, (ee) quoties correptus est, Angli
per <i>i</i> breve, exprimunt; quum vero producitur, scribunt
ut plurimum per <i>ee</i>, non raro tamen per <i>ie</i>; vel etiam
per <i>ea</i>; ut, <i>sit</i>, <i>fit</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>fill</i>, <i>fiend</i>, <i>near</i>," &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Wallis,
Gram. Sect. 2.</p>

<p>Ash confirms the opinion. "<i>Ee</i> has one sound, as
in <i>see</i>, <i>thee</i>, and coincides with the narrow <i>i</i>."&mdash;Gram.
Diss. pref. to his Dic.</p>

<p>Kenrick's arrangement of the <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> vowels
is exactly similar to mine.</p>

<p>Sheridan entertains a different opinion respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the short <i>i</i> and <i>e</i>. He considers them as distinct vowels,
incapable of prolongation. Rhet. Gram. pref. to
his Dict. page 16. In this he differs from most other
writers upon the subject, who have attended to the
philosophical distinctions of sounds. This appears to
be an inaccuracy in his distribution of the vowels; altho
it cannot affect the practice of speaking.</p>

<p>The sound of the Roman <i>i</i>, it is agreed on all hands,
was that of the English <i>ee</i>. It retains that sound still
in the Italian, French and Spanish, which are immediately
derived from the Latin. It had its long and short
sounds in Latin; as in <i>vidi</i>, <i>homini</i>; the first pronounced
<i>veedee</i>, and the last <i>homini</i>, as we now pronounce
<i>i</i> in <i>fill</i>. The French preserve the long sound, and lay
it down as a general rule, that <i>i</i> is pronounced like the
English <i>ee</i>: Yet in discourse they actually shorten the
sound, and in <i>sentimens</i>, <i>ressentiment</i>, &amp;c. pronounce <i>i</i> as
we do in <i>civil</i>. In the French <i>motif</i>, <i>i</i> is long like <i>ee</i>;
in this and all similar terminations, we shorten the
sound, <i>motiv</i>. Mr. Sheridan, in this particular, is evidently
singular and probably wrong.</p>

<p>That <i>e</i> in <i>let</i> is but the short abrupt sound of <i>a</i> in
<i>late</i>, is not so clear; but to me is evident. There is
little or no difference in the position of the organs with
which we pronounce both vowels. The Roman, Italian,
Spanish and French <i>e</i> is considered as the representative
of the English <i>a</i> in <i>late</i>, <i>made</i>; and yet in
common discourse, it is shortened into the sound of <i>e</i>
in <i>let</i>, <i>men</i>: Witness, <i>legere</i>, <i>avec</i>, <i>emmen&eacute;</i>, <i>bueno</i>, <i>entendido</i>:
We observe the same in English; for <i>said</i>, <i>any</i>,
<i>many</i>, which are pronounced <i>sed</i>, <i>enny</i>, <i>menny</i>, exhibit
the same vowel or short <i>a</i>; the <i>e</i> being the abrupt
sound of <i>ai</i> in <i>said</i>. I must therefore differ from Mr.
Sheridan, and still believe that <i>e</i> in <i>let</i>, and <i>i</i> in <i>fit</i>, are
capable of prolongation. Children, when, instead of
a comparison, they would express the superlative by an
emphasis, say <i>leetle</i> instead of <i>little</i>; which is a mere
prolongation of <i>i</i> short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sheridan, in my opinion, is guilty of an error
of greater consequence, in marking the two qualities of
sound in <i>bard</i> and <i>bad</i> with the same figure. He distinguishes
the different qualities of sound in <i>pool</i> and
<i>full</i>, and in <i>not</i> and <i>naught</i>; and why he should omit
the distinction of sound in <i>bard</i> and <i>bad</i>, <i>ask</i> and <i>man</i>,
is to me inconceiveable. The last distinction is as obvious
as the others which he has marked; and the defect
of his scheme must lead a foreigner into mistakes.
His scheme is singular; Kenrick, Perry and Burn all
make a distinction in the time of pronouncing <i>a</i> in <i>ask</i>
and <i>at</i>; and even Scott, who copies Sheridan's pronunciation
almost implicitly, still makes the same distinction.</p>

<p>"Non multum differt hic sonus (w) ab Anglorum

<p>"It is indeed on the celerity of utterance, that all
the difference, in many cases, between consonants and
vowels depends; as in <i>w</i> and <i>y</i>, in English; which,
being discharged quickly, perform the office of consonants,
in giving form only to the succeeding vowel;
but when protracted or drawled out, acquire a tone and
become the vocal <i>oo</i> and <i>ee</i>."&mdash;&mdash;Kenrick, Rhet.
Gram. p. 4.</p>

<p>Perry has adopted this opinion and contends warmly
that <i>w</i> is a consonant. If <i>w</i> is a vowel, says he, then
<i>wool</i>, <i>wolf</i>, will be pronounced <i>oo-ool</i>, <i>oo-olf</i>, or <i>ool</i>, <i>olf</i>. I
am sensible that in the beginning of words, <i>w</i> has not
precisely the power of <i>oo</i>; but it is not clear from this
fact that it has the properties of a consonant. Place a
vowel before <i>w</i>, as, <i>ow</i>, and there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> compression of
the lips or other parts of the mouth, to obstruct the
sound, as there is produced by <i>b</i> or <i>m</i>, in <i>eb</i> and <i>em</i>.</p>

<p>In opposition to the authorities mentioned, Sheridan
ranks <i>w</i> among the vowels, and supposes it to form
dipthongs with the other vowels, as in <i>well</i>, <i>will</i>, &amp;c.
It appears to me to be a letter rather of an ambiguous
nature, of which we have others in the language.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that by old authors <i>y</i> was often
used for <i>g</i>; <i>yeve</i> for <i>give</i>; <i>foryete</i> for <i>forget</i>.&mdash;&mdash; Chaucer,
Knight's Tale, 1884.</p>

<p>I have observed that some foreigners pronounce
<i>year</i>, in the same manner nearly as they do <i>ear</i>; and
<i>yeast</i> is commonly pronounced <i>east</i>. This pronunciation
would easily lead a man into the supposition that
<i>y</i> is merely <i>ee</i> short. But the pronunciation is vicious.</p>

<p>I observe also that Mr. Sheridan says, "<i>ye</i> has the
sound of <i>e</i> long in <i>ye</i>; of <i>a</i> long in <i>yea</i>; of <i>e</i> long in
<i>year</i>, <i>yean</i>; and of <i>e</i> short in <i>yearn</i>, <i>yell</i>, &amp;c." This confirms
my opinion, and is a proof that he does not pronounce
<i>y</i> at all.</p>

<p>If <i>y</i> has the sound of <i>e</i> in <i>year</i>, then <i>e</i> has <i>no</i> sound,
or there are in the word, <i>two</i> sounds of <i>e</i>, which no
person will undertake to assert. The dispute however
is easily settled. I have learnt by attending to the conversation
of well bred Englishmen, that they do not
pronounce <i>y</i> at all in <i>year</i> and many other words. They
say <i>ear</i>, <i>e</i>, for <i>year</i>, <i>ye</i>; and the sound of <i>e</i>, they erroneously
suppose to be that of <i>y</i>. In America, <i>y</i> has in
these words, the consonant sound it has in <i>young</i>; and
the English pronunciation must in this instance be
faulty.</p>

<p>"Now the harmony of prose arises from the same
principle with that which constitutes the harmony of
verse; viz. numbers; or such a disposition of the words
as throws them into just metrical feet, but very different
from those which constitute any species of verse."&mdash;Essay
on the Power of Numbers, &amp;c. page 4. Introd.</p>

<p>"A good stile is both <i>expressive</i> and <i>harmonious</i>.
The former depends on the happy choice of the words
to convey our ideas; the other on the happy choice of
numbers in the disposition of the words. The language
of some is expressive, but unharmonious; that
is, the writer's words strongly convey his sentiments,
but the order in which they are placed creates a sound
unpleasant to the ear. The stile of others is harmonious
but not expressive; where the periods are well
turned and the numbers well adapted, but the sense
obscure. The former satisfies the mind, but offends the
ear; the latter gratifies the ear, but disgusts the mind.
A good stile entertains and pleases both," &amp;c&mdash;&mdash; Ibm.
2d. Part, page 17.</p>

<p>The author proceeds to illustrate his doctrines by
showing in what the harmony of prose consists. He
remarks that the words should in some degree be an
echo to the sense, in prose as well as verse.</p>

<p>He proceeds&mdash;"Every sentence may be conceived as
divisible into distinct and separate clauses; every clause,
where there is an apparent cessation of the voice, should
always end with a generous foot; and all the preceding
numbers be so intermixt, that the short ones be duly
qualified by the succeeding long ones; reserving the
best and most harmonious number for the cadence."</p>

<p>To show how much depends on the proper arrangement
of words, he quotes the following instance&mdash;"A
divine, speaking of the Trinity, hath this expression&mdash;It
is a mystery which we firmly believe the truth of,
and humbly adore the depth of." Here the lang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>uage
is expressive, but not harmonious; not merely because
the clauses end with the particle <i>of</i>, but because they abound
with feeble numbers, <i>Pyrrhics</i> and <i>Trochees</i>.
Let us change the disposition of the feet&mdash;"It is a mystery,
the truth of which we firmly believe, and the
depths of which we humbly adore." The difference in
the melody is very perceiveable. The force and music
of the last disposition is increased by the Iambics and
Anap&aelig;sts.</p>

<p>The most forceable feet, and those best adapted to
sublime and serious subjects, are those which contain
the most long syllables, or end in a long syllable; as
the Iambic, the Spondee, the Anap&aelig;st. The weak
feet are those which have the most short syllables or end
in a short syllable; as the Pyrrhic, the Trochee, the
Tribrach.</p>

<p>The want of proper measures, or a mixture of weak
and strong syllables, is very remarkable in a passage of
the Declaration of Independence. "We must therefore
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our
separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
<i>enemies in war</i>, <i>&#301;n p&#275;ace</i>, <i>fri&#275;nds</i>." The three last
syllables form, if any thing, a Bacchic; the first syllable,
short, and the two others, long. But in a just pronunciation,
the foot is necessarily broken by a pause after
<i>peace</i>. This interruption, and the two long syllables,
render the close of the sentence extremely heavy.
The period is concise and expressive, as it stands; but
the arrangement might be much more harmonious&mdash;"O&#365;r
&#275;n&#277;m&#301;es &#301;n w&#257;r; &#301;n p&#275;ace, o&#365;r fri&#275;nds." Here
the measure and melody are perfect; the period closing
with three Iambics, preceded by a Pyrrhic.</p>

<p>There seem to have been among our Saxon ancestors
two verbs of nearly or exactly the same signification,
<i>may</i> and <i>might</i>; and <i>mowe</i> and <i>mought</i>. There
is some reason to think they were not synonimous;
that <i>may</i> was used to express <i>possibility</i>, as <i>I may go next
week</i>; and <i>mowe</i> to express <i>power</i>, as <i>they mowen go</i>, they
are able to go. But it is not certain that such a distinction
ever existed. The Germans use <i>moegen</i>, in
the infinitive; <i>mag</i>, in the indic. pres. <i>m&aelig;ge</i>, in the
subj. pres. in the imperfect of the ind. <i>mochte</i>; and in
the imp. of the subj. <i>m&aelig;chte</i>. The English use <i>may</i>
and <i>might</i> solely in their writing; but <i>mought</i> is still
pronounced in some parts of America.</p>

<p><i>Holpe</i> or <i>holp</i> was not obsolete when the Bible
was last translated, in the reign of king James; for it
occurs in several places in that translation. It occurs
frequently in old authors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>
Skelton El. on Earl of Northum. l. 47.<br />
</p>

<p>In Virginia it is pronounced <i>hope</i>. "Shall I hope
you, Sir."</p>

<p>But we must look among the New England common
people for ancient English phrases; for they have
been 160 years sequestered in some measure from the
world, and their language has not suffered material
changes from their first settlement to the present time.
Hence most of the phrases, used by Shakespear, Congreve,
and other writers who have described English
manners and recorded the language of all classes of people,
are still heard in the common discourse of the New
England yeomanry.</p>

<p>The verb <i>be</i>, in the indicative, present tense, which
Lowth observes is almost obsolete in England, is still
used after the ancient manner, I <i>be</i>, we <i>be</i>, you <i>be</i>, they <i>be</i>.
The old plural <i>housen</i> is still used for houses. The old
verb <i>wol</i> for will, and pronounced <i>wool</i>, is not yet fallen
into disuse. This was the verb principally used in
Chaucer's time, and it now lives in the purest branch
of the Teutonic, the German.</p>

<p>For many years, I had supposed the word <i>dern</i> in
the sense of <i>great</i> or <i>severe</i>, was local i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>n New England.
Perhaps it may not now be used any where else; but it
was once a common English word. Chaucer uses it in
the sense of <i>secret</i>, <i>earnest</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</p>

<p>The word is in common use in New England and
pronounced <i>darn</i>. It has not however the sense it had
formerly; it is now used as an adverb to qualify an adjective,
as <i>darn sweet</i>; denoting a great degree of the
quality.</p>

<p>The New England people preserve the ancient use
of <i>there</i> and <i>here</i> after a word or sentence, designating
the <i>place where</i>; as <i>this here</i>, <i>that there</i>. It is called vulgar
in English; and indeed the addition of <i>here</i> or <i>there</i>
is generally tautological. It is however an ancient practice;
and the French retain it in the pure elegant language
of their country; <i>ce pays l&agrave;</i>, <i>celui l&agrave;</i>, <i>cet homme
ici</i>; where we observe this difference only between the
French and English idioms, that in French, the adverb
follows the noun, <i>that country there</i>, <i>this man here</i>;
whereas in English, the adverb precedes the noun, <i>that
there country</i>, <i>this here man</i>. This form of speech seems
to have been coeval with the primitive Saxon, otherwise
it would not have prevailed so generally among the common
people.</p>

<p>It has been before remarked that the word <i>ax</i> for
<i>ask</i> was used in England, and even in the royal assent
to acts of parliament, down to the reign of Henry VI.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</p>

<p>This word to <i>ax</i> is still frequent in New England.</p>

<p>I no not know whether our American sportsmen use
the word, <i>ferret</i>, in the sense of driving animals from
their lurking places. But the word is used in some
parts of New England, and applied figuratively to many
transactions in life. So in Congreve:</p>

<p>"Where is this apocryphal elder? I'll <i>ferret</i> him."&mdash;&mdash;Old
Bach, act 4, fc. 21.</p>

<p>Sometimes, but rarely, we hear the old imperative
of the Saxon <i>thafian</i>, now pronounced <i>thof</i>. But it is
generally pronounced as it is written, <i>tho</i>. It is remarked
by Horne, that <i>thof</i> is still frequent among the common
people of England.</p>

<p><i>Gin</i> or <i>gyn</i> for <i>given</i> is still used in America; as
Bishop Wilkins remarks, it is in the North of England.</p>

<p><i>Without</i>, in the sense of <i>unless</i>, is as frequent as
any word in the language, and even among the learned.
It is commonly accounted inelegant, and writers have
lately substituted <i>unless</i>: But I do not see the propriety
of discarding <i>without</i>, for its meaning is exactly the same
as that of <i>unless</i>. It is demonstrated that they are both
the imperatives of old verbs. <i>Without</i>, is <i>be out</i>, <i>be away</i>;
and <i>unless</i> is <i>dismiss</i>, or <i>be apart</i>. Instead of the
imperative Chaucer generally uses the participle, <i>withouten</i>,
<i>being out</i>.</p>

<p>The best writers use <i>without</i> in the sense of <i>unless</i>.</p>

<p>"&mdash;And if he can't be cured <i>without</i> I suck the poison
from his wounds, I'm afraid he won't recover his

confessor in that affair, <i>without</i> you could have kept his

<p>The best speakers use the word in this manner, in
common discourse, and I must think, with propriety.</p>

<p><i>Peek</i> is also used corruptedly for <i>peep</i>. By a similar
change of the last consonant, <i>chirk</i> is used for <i>chirp</i>,
<i>to make a cheerful noise</i>. This word is wholly lost, except
in New England. It is there used for <i>comfortably</i>,
<i>bravely</i>, <i>cheerful</i>; as when one enquires about a sick
person, it is said, he is <i>chirk</i>. <i>Chirp</i> is still used to express
the singing of birds, but the <i>chirk</i> of New England
is not understood, and therefore derided. Four
hundred years ago it was a polite term.</p>

<p><i>Shet</i> for <i>shut</i> is now become vulgar; yet this is the
true original orthography and pronunciation. It is
from the Saxon <i>scitten</i>, and I believe was always spelt
<i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>shette</i> or <i>shet</i>, till after Chaucer's time, for he was a correct
writer in his age, and always spelt it in that manner.</p>

<p>And in a variety of other places. This word is almost
universally pronounced <i>shet</i> among all classes of people,
not only in New England, but in Great Britain and
the southern states of America. How the spelling
came to be changed, is not known; but it was certainly
a corruption.</p>

<p><i>An</i> for <i>if</i> is seen in most old authors. It remains
among the common people, both in England and America.
"<i>An</i> please your honor;" that is, "<i>if</i> your
honor please." In New England, the phrases in which
it occurs most frequently are, "Let him go, <i>an</i> he will;"
"Go, <i>an</i> you will;" and others of a similar kind.</p>

<p><i>Because</i> and <i>becase</i> were used promiscuously by
our ancestors. <i>Becase</i> is found in some ancient writings,
tho not so frequently as <i>because</i>. In New England, we
frequently hear <i>becase</i> to this day. It is pronounced <i>becaze</i>.
It is a compound of <i>be</i> and <i>cause</i> or <i>case</i>; both of
these words with the verb <i>be</i> make good English; but
<i>becase</i> is vulgar.</p>

<p>The vulgar pronunciation of <i>such</i> is <i>sich</i>. This is
but a small deviation from the ancient elegant pronunciation,
which was <i>swich</i> or <i>swiche</i>, as the word is spelt
in Chaucer. Such is the force of national practice:
And altho the country people in New England, sometimes
drawl their words in speaking, and, like their
brethren, often make false concord, yet their idiom is
purely Saxon or English; and in a vast number of instances,
they have adhered to the true phrases, where
people, who despise their plain manners, have run into
error. Thus they say, "a man is going <i>by</i>," and not <i>going
past</i>, which is nonsense: They say, "I <i>purpose</i> to go,"
and not <i>propose</i> to go, which is not good English. They
say, "a ship <i>lies</i> in harbor," not <i>lays</i>, which is a modern
corruption. They say, "I <i>have</i> done," and never "I
<i>am</i> done," which is nonsense. They say, "it was <i>on</i>
Monday evening," not "<i>of</i> a Monday evening," which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
is an error. They never use the absurd phrases "<i>expect
it was</i>;" and "the ship will sail in <i>all</i> next week."
They never say "he is home," but always, "at home."
They use the old phrase, "it is half <i>after</i> six o'clock,"
which is more correct than <i>half past six</i>. They say, if
a person is not in health, he is <i>sick</i>. The modern English
laugh at them, because the English say a man is <i>ill</i>;
and confine sick to express the idea of a nausea in the
stomach. The English are wrong, and the New England
people use the word in its true sense, which extends
to all bodily disorders, as it is used by the pure
English writers. <i>Ill</i> is a contraction of <i>evil</i>; and denotes
a moral disorder. Its application to bodily complaints
is a modern practice, and its meaning figurative.
So that whatever improprieties may have crept into
their practice of speaking, they actually preserve more
of the genuin idiom of the English tongue, than many
of the modern fine speakers who set up for standards.</p>

<p>The letters <i>ch</i> in Roman answered nearly to the
Greek <i>ki</i> or <i>chi</i>; for <i>c</i> had the sound of <i>k</i>, at least before
<i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>. <i>Ch</i> or <i>kh</i> was therefore the proper combination
for the Greek letter; which had the sound of <i>k</i> followed
by an aspirate. This combination was copied into our
language; and perhaps the aspirate was once pronounced,
like the Irish guttural in <i>Cochran</i>. But when the
aspirate was lost, <i>k</i> became the proper representative of
the sound. It is wished, that in all the derivatives from
the ancient languages, where this character occurs, <i>k</i>
might be substituted for <i>ch</i>; that persons unacquainted
with etymology, might not mistake and give <i>ch</i> its English
sound.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> It is commonly observed, that different climates, airs and aliments,
do very much diversify the tone of the parts and muscles of human bodies;
on some of which the modulation of the voice much depends. The
peculiar moisture of one country, the drought of another (other causes
from food, &amp;c. concurring) extend or contract, swell or attenuate, the
organs of the voice, that the sound made thereby is rendered either shrill
or hoarse, soft or hard, plain or lisping, in proportion to that contraction
or extension. And hence it is, that the Chinese and Tartars have
some sounds in their language, that Europeans can scarcely imitate:
And it is well known in Europe itself, that an Englishman is not
able agreeably to converse with a stranger, even in one and the same
Latin; nay, even in England, it is noted by Mr. Camden and Dr. Fuller,
that the natives of Carleton Curlew in Leicestershire, by a certain
peculiarity of the place, have the turn of their voice very different from
those of the neighboring villages.</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been observed by all writers
on the English language, that the
orthography or spelling of words
is very irregular; the same letters
often representing different sounds,
and the same sounds often expressed
by different letters. For this
irregularity, two principal causes
may be assigned:</p>

<p>1. The changes to which the pronunciation of a
language is liable, from the progress of science and civilization.</p>

<p>2. The mixture of different languages, occasioned
by revolutions in England, or by a predilection of the
learned, for words of foreign growth and ancient origin.</p>

<p>To the first cause, may be ascribed the difference between
the spelling and pronunciation of Saxon words.
The northern nations of Europe originally spoke much
in gutturals. This is evident from the number of aspirates
and guttural letters, which still remain in the
orthography of words derived from those nations;
and from the modern pronunciation of the collateral
branches of the Teutonic, the Dutch, Scotch and German.
Thus <i>k</i> before <i>n</i> was once pronounced; as in
<i>knave</i>, <i>know</i>; the <i>gh</i> in <i>might</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>daughter</i>, and other
similar words; the <i>g</i> in <i>reign</i>, <i>feign</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But as savages proceed in forming languages, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
lose the guttural sounds, in some measure, and adopt
the use of labials, and the more open vowels. The
ease of speaking facilitates this progress, and the pronunciation
of words is softened, in proportion to a national
refinement of manners. This will account for
the difference between the ancient and modern languages
of France, Spain and Italy; and for the difference
between the soft pronunciation of the present languages
of those countries, and the more harsh and guttural
pronunciation of the northern inhabitants of Europe.</p>

<p>In this progress, the English have lost the sounds of
most of the guttural letters. The <i>k</i> before <i>n</i> in <i>know</i>,
the <i>g</i> in <i>reign</i>, and in many other words, are become
mute in practice; and the <i>gh</i> is softened into the sound
of <i>f</i>, as in <i>laugh</i>, or is silent, as in <i>brought</i>.</p>

<p>To this practice of softening the sounds of letters, or
wholly suppressing those which are harsh and disagreeable,
may be added a popular tendency to abbreviate words
of common use. Thus <i>Southwark</i>, by a habit of quick
pronunciation, is become <i>Suthark</i>; <i>Worcester</i> and <i>Leicester</i>,
are become <i>Wooster</i> and <i>Lester</i>; <i>business</i>, <i>bizness</i>;
<i>colonel</i>, <i>curnel</i>; <i>cannot</i>, <i>will not</i>, <i>cant</i>, <i>wont</i>.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> In this
manner the final <i>e</i> is not heard in many modern words,
in which it formerly made a syllable. The words
<i>clothes</i>, <i>cares</i>, and most others of the same kind, were
formerly pronounced in two syllables.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Of the other cause of irregularity in the spelling of
our language, I have treated sufficiently in the first Dissertation.
It is here necessary only to remark, that
when words have been introduced from a foreign language
into the English, they have generally retained
the orthography of the original, however ill adapted to
express the English pronunciation. Thus <i>fatigue</i>, <i>marine</i>,
<i>chaise</i>, retain their French dress, while, to represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>the true pronunciation in English, they should be spelt
<i>fateeg</i>, <i>mareen</i>, <i>shaze</i>. Thus thro an ambition to exhibit
the etymology of words, the English, in <i>Philip</i>,
<i>physic</i>, <i>character</i>, <i>chorus</i>, and other Greek derivatives, preserve
the representatives of the original &#934; and &#935;; yet
these words are pronounced, and ought ever to have
been spelt, <i>Fillip</i>, <i>fyzzic</i> or <i>fizzic</i>, <i>karacter</i>, <i>korus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>But such is the state of our language. The pronunciation
of the words which are strictly <i>English</i>, has been
gradually changing for ages, and since the revival of
science in Europe, the language has received a vast accession
of words from other languages, many of which
retain an orthography very ill suited to exhibit the true
pronunciation.</p>

<p>The question now occurs; ought the Americans
to retain these faults which produce innumerable in
conveniencies in the acquisition and use of the language,
or ought they at once to reform these abuses,
and introduce order and regularity into the orthography
of the AMERICAN TONGUE?</p>

<p>Let us consider this subject with some attention.</p>

<p>Several attempts were formerly made in England to
rectify the orthography of the language.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> But I apprehend
their schemes failed of success, rather on account
of their intrinsic difficulties, than on account of
any necessary impracticability of a reform. It was
proposed, in most of these schemes, not merely to throw
out superfluous and silent letters, but to introduce a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>of new characters. Any attempt on such a plan must
undoubtedly prove unsuccessful. It is not to be expected
that an orthography, perfectly regular and simple,
such as would be formed by a "Synod of Grammarians
on principles of science," will ever be substituted
for that confused mode of spelling which is now established.
But it is apprehended that great improvements
may be made, and an orthography almost regular, or
such as shall obviate most of the present difficulties
which occur in learning our language, may be introduced
and established with little trouble and opposition.</p>

<p>The principal alterations, necessary to render our
orthography sufficiently regular and easy, are these:</p>

<p>1. The omission of all superfluous or silent letters;
as <i>a</i> in <i>bread</i>. Thus <i>bread</i>, <i>head</i>, <i>give</i>, <i>breast</i>, <i>built</i>,
<i>meant</i>, <i>realm</i>, <i>friend</i>, would be spelt, <i>bred</i>, <i>hed</i>, <i>giv</i>, <i>brest</i>,
<i>bilt</i>, <i>ment</i>, <i>relm</i>, <i>frend</i>. Would this alteration produce any
inconvenience, any embarrassment or expense? By no
means. On the other hand, it would lessen the trouble
of writing, and much more, of learning the language;
it would reduce the true pronunciation to a certainty;
and while it would assist foreigners and our own children
in acquiring the language, it would render the
pronunciation uniform, in different parts of the country,
and almost prevent the possibility of changes.</p>

<p>2. A substitution of a character that has a certain
definite sound, for one that is more vague and
indeterminate. Thus by putting <i>ee</i> instead of <i>ea</i> or <i>ie</i>,
the words <i>mean</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>speak</i>, <i>grieve</i>, <i>zeal</i>, would become
<i>meen</i>, <i>neer</i>, <i>speek</i>, <i>greev</i>, <i>zeel</i>. This alteration could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>occasion a moment's trouble; at the same time it
would prevent a doubt respecting the pronunciation;
whereas the <i>ea</i> and <i>ie</i> having different sounds, may
give a learner much difficulty. Thus <i>greef</i> should be
substituted for <i>grief</i>; <i>kee</i> for <i>key</i>; <i>beleev</i> for <i>believe</i>;
<i>laf</i> for <i>laugh</i>; <i>dawter</i> for <i>daughter</i>; <i>plow</i> for <i>plough</i>;
<i>tuf</i> for <i>tough</i>; <i>proov</i> for <i>prove</i>; <i>blud</i> for <i>blood</i>; and
<i>draft</i> for <i>draught</i>. In this manner <i>ch</i> in Greek derivatives,
should be changed into <i>k</i>; for the English <i>ch</i> has
a soft sound, as in <i>cherish</i>; but <i>k</i> always a hard sound.
Therefore <i>character</i>, <i>chorus</i>, <i>cholic</i>, <i>architecture</i>, should
be written <i>karacter</i>, <i>korus</i>, <i>kolic</i>, <i>arkitecture</i>; and were
they thus written, no person could mistake their true
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Thus <i>ch</i> in French derivatives should be changed
into sh; <i>machine</i>, <i>chaise</i>, <i>chevalier</i>, should be written
<i>masheen</i>, <i>shaze</i>, <i>shevaleer</i>; and <i>pique</i>, <i>tour</i>, <i>oblique</i>, should
be written <i>peek</i>, <i>toor</i>, <i>obleek</i>.</p>

<p>3. A trifling alteration in a character, or the
addition of a point would distinguish different sounds,
without the substitution of a new character. Thus a
very small stroke across <i>th</i> would distinguish its two
sounds. A point over a vowel, in this manner, <i>&#775;a</i> or
<i>&#279;</i>, or <i>&#775;i</i>, might answer all the purposes of different letters.
And for the dipthong <i>ow</i>, let the two letters be
united by a small stroke, or both engraven on the same
piece of metal, with the left hand line of the <i>w</i> united
to the <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>These, with a few other inconsiderable alterations,
would answer every purpose, and render the orthography
sufficiently correct and regular.</p>

<p>The advantages to be derived from these alterations
are numerous, great and permanent.</p>

<p>1. The simplicity of the orthography would facilitate
the learning of the language. It is now the work
of years for children to learn to spell; and after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>,
the business is rarely accomplished. A few men, who
are bred to some business that requires constant exercise
in writing, finally learn to spell most words without
hesitation; but most people remain, all their lives,
imperfect masters of spelling, and liable to make mistakes,
whenever they take up a pen to write a short
note. Nay, many people, even of education and fashion,
never attempt to write a letter, without frequently
consulting a dictionary.</p>

<p>But with the proposed orthography, a child would
learn to spell, without trouble, in a very short time, and
the orthography being very regular, he would ever afterwards
find it difficult to make a mistake. It would,
in that case, be as difficult to spell <i>wrong</i>, as it is now
to spell <i>right</i>.</p>

<p>Besides this advantage, foreigners would be able
to acquire the pronunciation of English, which is now
so difficult and embarrassing, that they are either wholly
discouraged on the first attempt, or obliged, after
many years labor, to rest contented with an imperfect
knowlege of the subject.</p>

<p>2. A correct orthography would render the pronunciation
of the language, as uniform as the spelling
in books. A general uniformity thro the United
States, would be the event of such a reformation as
I am here recommending. All persons, of every rank,
would speak with some degree of precision and uniformity.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
Such a uniformity in these states is very desireable;
it would remove prejudice, and conciliate mutual
affection and respect.</p>

<p>3. Such a reform would diminish the number of
letters about one sixteenth or eighteenth. This would
save a page in eighteen; and a saving of an eighteenth
in the expense of books, is an advantage that should
not be overlooked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>
<p>4. But a capital advantage of this reform in these
states would be, that it would make a difference between
the English orthography and the American.
This will startle those who have not attended to the
subject; but I am confident that such an event is an
object of vast political consequence. For,</p>

<p>The alteration, however small, would encourage the
publication of books in our own country. It would
render it, in some measure, necessary that all books
should be printed in America. The English would
never copy our orthography for their own use; and
consequently the same impressions of books would
not answer for both countries. The inhabitants of
the present generation would read the English impressions;
but posterity, being taught a different
spelling, would prefer the American orthography.</p>

<p>Besides this, a <i>national language</i> is a band of <i>national
union</i>. Every engine should be employed to render
the people of this country <i>national</i>; to call their
attachments home to their own country; and to inspire
them with the pride of national character. However
they may boast of Independence, and the freedom
of their government, yet their <i>opinions</i> are not sufficiently
independent; an astonishing respect for the
arts and literature of their parent country, and a blind
imitation of its manners, are still prevalent among the
Americans. Thus an habitual respect for another
country, deserved indeed and once laudable, turns their
attention from their own interests, and prevents their
respecting themselves.</p>


<h3>OBJECTIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>1. "This reform of the Alphabet would oblige
people to relearn the language, or it could not be introduced."</p>

<p>But the alterations proposed are so few and so simple,
that an hour's attention would enable any person
to read the new orthography with facility; and a
week's practice would render it so familiar, that a person
would write it without hesitation or mistake.
Would this small inconvenience prevent its adoption?
Would not the numerous national and literary advantages,
resulting from the change, induce Americans to
make so inconsiderable a sacrifice of time and attention?
I am persuaded they would.</p>

<p>But it would not be necessary that men advanced
beyond the middle stage of life, should be at the pains
to learn the proposed orthography. They would,
without inconvenience, continue to use the present.
They would read the <i>new</i> orthography, without difficulty;
but they would write in the <i>old</i>. To men thus
advanced, and even to the present generation in general,
if they should not wish to trouble themselves with a
change, the reformation would be almost a matter of
indifference. It would be sufficient that children
should be taught the new orthography, and that as fast
as they come upon the stage, they should be furnished
with books in the American spelling. The progress
of printing would be proportioned to the demand for
books among the rising generation. This progressive
introduction of the scheme would be extremely easy;
children would learn the proposed orthography more
easily than they would the old; and the present generation
would not be troubled with the change; so that
none but the obstinate and capricious could raise objections
or make any opposition. The change would
be so inconsiderable, and made on such simple principles,
that a column in each newspaper, printed in the
new spelling, would in six months, familiarize most
people to the change, show the advantages of it, and
imperceptibly remove their objections. The only steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
necessary to ensure success in the attempt to introduce
this reform, would be, a resolution of Congress, ordering
all their acts to be engrossed in the new orthography,
and recommending the plan to the several universities
in America; and also a resolution of the universities
to encourage and support it. The printers would
begin the reformation by publishing short paragraphs
and small tracts in the new orthography; school books
would first be published in the same; curiosity would
excite attention to it, and men would be gradually reconciled
to the plan.</p>

<p>2. "This change would render our present books
useless."</p>

<p>This objection is, in some measure, answered under
the foregoing head. The truth is, it would not have
this effect. The difference of orthography would not
render books printed in one, illegible to persons acquainted
only with the other. The difference would
not be so great as between the orthography of Chaucer,
and of the present age; yet Chaucer's works are still
read with ease.</p>

<p>3. "This reformation would injure the language
by obscuring etymology."</p>

<p>This objection is unfounded. In general, it is not
true that the change would obscure etymology; in a
few instances, it might; but it would rather restore the
etymology of many words; and if it were true that
the change would obscure it, this would be no objection
to the reformation.</p>

<p>It will perhaps surprize my readers to be told that,
in many particular words, the modern spelling is less
correct than the ancient. Yet this is a truth that reflects
dishonor on our modern refiners of the language.
Chaucer, four hundred years ago, wrote <i>bilder</i> for <i>builder</i>;
<i>dedly</i> for <i>dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>ly</i>; <i>ernest</i> for <i>earnest</i>; <i>erly</i> for <i>early</i>;
<i>brest</i> for <i>breast</i>; <i>hed</i> for <i>head</i>; and certainly his spelling
was the most agreeable to the pronunciation.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Sidney
wrote <i>bin</i>, <i>examin</i>, <i>sutable</i>, with perfect propriety. Dr.
Middleton wrote <i>explane</i>, <i>genuin</i>, <i>revele</i>, which is the
most easy and correct orthography of such words; and
also <i>luster</i>, <i>theater</i>, for <i>lustre</i>, <i>theatre</i>. In these and
many other instances, the modern spelling is a corruption;
so that allowing many improvements to have
been made in orthography, within a century or two,
we must acknowlege also that many corruptions have
been introduced.</p>

<p>In answer to the objection, that a change of orthography
would obscure etymology, I would remark, that
the etymology of most words is already lost, even to
the learned; and to the unlearned, etymology is never
known. Where is the man that can trace back our
English words to the elementary radicals? In a few instances,
the student has been able to reach the primitive
roots of words; but I presume the radicals of one
tenth of the words in our language, have never yet
been discovered, even by Junius, Skinner, or any other
etymologist. Any man may look into Johnson or Ash,
and find that <i>flesh</i> is derived from the Saxon <i>floce</i>; <i>child</i>
from <i>cild</i>; <i>flood</i> from <i>flod</i>; <i>lad</i> from <i>leode</i>; and <i>loaf</i>
from <i>laf</i> or <i>hlaf</i>. But this discovery will answer no
other purpose, than to show, that within a few hundred
years, the spelling of some words has been a little changed:
We should still be at a vast distance from the
primitive roots.</p>

<p>In many instances indeed etymology will assist the
learned in understanding the composition and true sense
of a word; and it throws much light upon the progress
of language. But the true sense of a complex term is
not always, nor generally, to be learnt from the sense of
the primitives or elementary words. The current
meaning of a word depends on its use in a nation. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>true sense is to be obtained by attending to good authors,
to dictionaries and to practice, rather than to derivation.
The former <i>must</i> be <i>right</i>; the latter <i>may</i>
lead us into <i>error</i>.</p>

<p>But to prove of how little consequence a knowlege
of etymology is to most people, let me mention a few
words. The word <i>sincere</i> is derived from the Latin,
<i>sine cera</i>, without wax; and thus it came to denote
<i>purity of mind</i>. I am confident that not a man in a
thousand ever suspected this to be the origin of the
word; yet all men, that have any knowlege of our language,
use the word in its true sense, and understand its
customary meaning, as well as Junius did, or any other
etymologist.</p>

<p><i>Yea</i> or <i>yes</i> is derived from the imperative of a verb,
<i>avoir</i> to have, as the word is now spelt. It signifies
therefore <i>have</i>, or <i>possess</i>, or <i>take</i> what you ask. But
does this explication assist us in using the word? And
does not every countryman who labors in the field, understand
and use the word with as much precision as
the profoundest philosophers?</p>

<p>The word <i>temper</i> is derived from an old root, <i>tem</i>,
which signified <i>water</i>. It was borrowed from the act
of <i>cooling</i>, or moderating heat. Hence the meaning of
<i>temperate</i>, <i>temperance</i>, and all the ramifications of the original
stock. But does this help us to the modern
current sense of these words? By no means. It leads
us to understand the formation of languages, and in
what manner an idea of a visible action gives rise to a
correspondent abstract idea; or rather, how a word,
from a literal and direct sense, may be applied to express
a variety of figurative and collateral ideas. Yet
the customary sense of the word is known by practice,
and as well understood by an illiterate man of tolerable
capacity, as by men of science.</p>

<p>The word <i>always</i> is compounded of <i>all</i> and <i>ways</i>;
it had originally no reference to time; and the etymology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
or composition of the word would only lead
us into error. The true meaning of words is that
which a nation in general annex to them. Etymology
therefore is of no use but to the learned; and for them
it will still be preserved, so far as it is now understood,
in dictionaries and other books that treat of this particular
subject.</p>

<p>4. "The distinction between words of different
meanings and similar sound would be destroyed."</p>

<p>"That distinction," to answer in the words of the
great Franklin, "is already destroyed in pronunciation."
Does not every man pronounce <i>all</i> and <i>awl</i> precisely
alike? And does the sameness of sound ever lead a
hearer into a mistake? Does not the construction render
the distinction easy and intelligible, the moment
the words of the sentence are heard? Is the word
<i>knew</i> ever mistaken for <i>new</i>, even in the rapidity of
pronouncing an animated oration? Was <i>peace</i> ever
mistaken for <i>piece</i>; <i>pray</i> for <i>prey</i>; <i>flour</i> for <i>flower</i>?
Never, I presume, is this similarity of sound the occasion
of mistakes.</p>

<p>If therefore an identity of <i>sound</i>, even in rapid speaking,
produces no inconvenience, how much less would
an identity of <i>spelling</i>, when the eye would have leisure
to survey the construction? But experience, the criterion
of truth, which has removed the objection in the first
case, will also assist us in forming our opinion in the last.</p>

<p>There are many words in our language which,
with the <i>same orthography</i>, have <i>two</i> or more <i>distinct
meanings</i>. The word <i>wind</i>, whether it signifies <i>to move
round</i>, or <i>air in motion</i>, has the <i>same spelling</i>; it exhibits
no distinction to the <i>eye</i> of a silent reader; and yet
its meaning is never mistaken. The construction
shows at sight in which sense the word is to be understood.
<i>Hail</i> is used as an expression of joy, or to signify
frozen drops of water, falling from the clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>.
<i>Rear</i> is to raise up, or it signifies the hinder part of an
army. <i>Lot</i> signifies fortune or destiny; a plat of
ground; or a certain proportion or share; and yet
does this diversity, this contrariety of meanings ever
occasion the least difficulty in the ordinary language of
books? It cannot be maintained. This diversity is
found in all languages;<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and altho it may be considered
as a defect, and occasion some trouble for foreign learners,
yet to natives it produces no sensible inconvenience.</p>

<p>5. "It is idle to conform the orthography of words
to the pronunciation, because the latter is continually
changing."</p>

<p>This is one of Dr. Johnson's objections, and it is
very unworthy of his judgement. So far is this circumstance
from being a real objection, that it is alone a sufficient
reason for the change of spelling. On his principle
of <i>fixing the orthography</i>, while the <i>pronunciation is
changing</i>, any <i>spoken language</i> must, in time, lose all relation
to the <i>written language</i>; that is, the sounds of
words would have no affinity with the letters that compose
them. In some instances, this is now the case; and
no mortal would suspect from the spelling, that <i>neighbour</i>,
<i>wrought</i>, are pronounced <i>nabur</i>, <i>rawt</i>. On this
principle, Dr. Johnson ought to have gone back some
centuries, and given us, in his dictionary, the primitive
Saxon orthography, <i>wol</i> for <i>will</i>; <i>ydilnesse</i> for <i>idleness</i>;
<i>eyen</i> for <i>eyes</i>; <i>eche</i> for <i>each</i>, &amp;c. Nay, he should have
gone as far as possible into antiquity, and, regardless of
the changes of pronunciation, given us the primitive
radical language in its purity. Happily for the language,
that doctrine did not prevail till his time; the
spelling of words changed with the pronunciation; to
these changes we are indebted for numberless improvements;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>and it is hoped that the progress of them, in conformity
with the national practice of speaking, will not
be obstructed by the erroneous opinion, even of Dr.
Johnson. How much more rational is the opinion of
Dr. Franklin, who says, "the orthography of our language
began to be fixed too soon." If the pronunciation
must vary, from age to age, (and some trifling
changes of language will always be taking place) common
sense would dictate a correspondent change of
spelling. Admit Johnson's principles; take his pedantic
orthography for the standard; let it be closely adhered
to in future; and the slow changes in the pronunciation
of our national tongue, will in time make
as great a difference between our <i>written</i> and <i>spoken</i> language,
as there is between the pronunciation of the
present English and German. The <i>spelling</i> will be no
more a guide to the pronunciation, than the orthography
of the German or Greek. This event is actually
taking place, in consequence of the stupid opinion, advanced
by Johnson and other writers, and generally
embraced by the nation.</p>

<p>All these objections appear to me of very inconsiderable
weight, when opposed to the great, substantial and
permanent advantages to be derived from a regular
national orthography.</p>

<p>Sensible I am how much easier it is to <i>propose</i> improvements,
than to <i>introduce</i> them. Every thing <i>new</i>
starts the idea of difficulty; and yet it is often mere novelty
that excites the appearance; for on a slight examination
of the proposal, the difficulty vanishes. When
we firmly <i>believe</i> a scheme to be practicable, the work
is <i>half</i> accomplished. We are more frequently deterred
by fear from making an attack, than repulsed in
the encounter.</p>

<p>Habit also is opposed to changes; for it renders even
our errors dear to us. Having surmounted all difficulties
in childhood, we forg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>et the labor, the fatigue, and
the perplexity we suffered in the attempt, and imagin
the progress of our studies to have been smooth and easy.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
What seems intrinsically right, is so merely thro
habit.</p>

<p>Indolence is another obstacle to improvements.
The most arduous task a reformer has to execute, is to
make people <i>think</i>; to rouse them from that lethargy,
which, like the mantle of sleep, covers them in repose
and contentment.</p>

<p>But America is in a situation the most favorable for
great reformations; and the present time is, in a singular
degree, auspicious. The minds of men in this
country have been awakened. New scenes have been,
for many years, presenting new occasions for exertion;
unexpected distresses have called forth the powers of
invention; and the application of new expedients has
demanded every possible exercise of wisdom and talents.
Attention is roused; the mind expanded; and the intellectual
faculties invigorated. Here men are prepared
to receive improvements, which would be rejected by
nations, whose habits have not been shaken by similar
events.</p>

<p><i>Now</i> is the time, and <i>this</i> the country, in which we
may expect success, in attempting changes favorable to
language, science and government. Delay, in the plan
here proposed, may be fatal; under a tranquil general
government, the minds of men may again sink into indolence;
a national acquiescence in error will follow;
and posterity be doomed to struggle with difficulties,
which time and accident will perpetually multiply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us then seize the present moment, and establish
a <i>national language</i>, as well as a national government.
Let us remember that there is a certain respect due to
the opinions of other nations. As an independent
people, our reputation abroad demands that, in all
things, we should be federal; be <i>national</i>; for if we
do not respect <i>ourselves</i>, we may be assured that <i>other
nations</i> will not respect us. In short, let it be impressed
upon the mind of every American, that to neglect the
means of commanding respect abroad, is treason against
the character and dignity of a brave independent
people.</p>

<p>To excite the more attention to this subject, I will
here subjoin what Dr. Franklin has done and written
to effect a reform in our mode of spelling. This sage
philosopher has suffered nothing useful to escape his
notice. He very early discovered the difficulties that
attend the learning of our language; and with his usual
ingenuity, invented a plan to obviate them. If any
objection can be made to his scheme,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> it is the substitution
of <i>new</i> characters, for <i>th</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>ng</i>, &amp;c. whereas a
small stroke, connecting the letters, would answer all
the purposes of new characters; as these combinations
would thus become single letters, with precise definite
sounds and suitable names.</p>

<p>A specimen of the Doctor's spelling cannot be here
given, as I have not the proper types;<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> but the arguments
in favor of a reformed mode of spelling shall be
given in his own words.</p>

<p><i>Copy of a Letter from Miss S&mdash;&mdash;, to Dr.</i> <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>who had sent her his Scheme of a Reformed Alphabet.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Dated, Kensington (England) Sept. 26, 1768.</i></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">DEAR SIR</span>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>

<p>I have transcribed your alphabet, &amp;c. which I
think might be of service to those who wish to acquire
an accurate pronunciation, if that could be fixed; but
I see many inconveniences, as well as difficulties, that
would attend the bringing your letters and orthography
into common use. All our etymologies would be lost;
consequently we could not ascertain the meaning of
many words; the distinction too between words of <i>different
meaning</i> and <i>similar</i> sound would be useless,<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> unless
we living writers publish new editions. In short, I
believe we must let people spell on in their old way, and
(as we find it easiest) do the same ourselves.&mdash;&mdash; With
ease and with sincerity I can, in the old way, subscribe

<p>
<span class="smcap">DEAR MADAM</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>The objection you make to rectifying our alphabet,
"that it will be attended with inconveniences and difficulties,"
is a very natural one; for it always occurs
when any reformation is proposed, whether in religion,
government, laws, and even down as low as roads and
wheel carriages. The true question then is not, whether
there will be no difficulties or inconveniences; but
whether the difficulties may not be surmounted; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>whether the conveniences will not, on the whole, be
greater than the inconveniences. In this case, the difficulties
are only in the beginning of the practice; when
they are once overcome, the advantages are lasting. To
either you or me, who spell well in the present mode, I imagine
the difficulty of changing that mode for the new,
is not so great, but that we might perfectly get over it in
a week's writing. As to those who do not spell well, if
the two difficulties are compared, viz. that of teaching
them true spelling in the present mode, and that of teaching
them the new alphabet and the new spelling according
to it, I am confident that the latter would be by far
the least. They naturally fall into the new method already,
as much as the imperfection of their alphabet
will admit of; their present <i>bad</i> spelling is only bad,
because contrary to the present <i>bad</i> rules; under the
new rules it would be <i>good</i>.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The difficulty of learning
to spell well in the old way is so great, that few attain
it; thousands and thousands writing on to old age,
without ever being able to acquire it. It is besides, a
difficulty continually increasing;<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> as the sound gradually
varies more and more from the spelling; and to
foreigners it makes the learning to pronounce our language,
as written in our books, almost impossible.</p>

<p>Now as to the inconveniences you mention: The
first is, "that all our etymologies would be lost; consequently
we could not ascertain the meaning of many
words." Etymologies are at present very uncertain;
but such as they are, the old books still preserve them,
and etymologists would there find them. Words in
the course of time, change their meaning, as well as
their spelling and pronunciation; and we do not look
to etymologies for their present meanings. If I should
call a man a <i>knave</i> and a <i>villain</i>, he would hardly be
satisfied with my telling him, that one of the words originally
signified a <i>lad</i> or <i>servant</i>, and the other an under
<i>plowman</i>, or the inhabitant of a village. It is from
present usage only, the meaning of words is to be determined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>
<p>Your second inconvenience is, "the distinction between
words of different meaning and similar sound
would be destroyed." That distinction is already destroyed
in pronouncing them; and we rely on the sense
alone of the sentence to ascertain which of the several
words, similar in sound, we intend. If this is sufficient
in the rapidity of discourse, it will be much more so in
written sentences, which may be read leisurely, and attended
to more particularly in case of difficulty, than
we can attend to a past sentence, while the speaker is
hurrying us along with new ones.</p>

<p>Your third inconvenience is, "that all the books
already written would be useless." This inconvenience
would only come on gradually in a course of ages.
I and you and other now living readers would hardly
forget the use of them. People would long learn to
read the old writing, tho they practised the new. And
the inconvenience is not greater than what has actually
happened in a similar case in Italy. Formerly its inhabitants
all spoke and wrote Latin; as the language
changed, the spelling followed it. It is true that at
present, a mere unlearned Italian cannot read the Latin
books, tho they are still read and understood by many.
But if the spelling had never been changed, he would
now have found it much more difficult to read and
write his own language;<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> for written words would
have had no relation to sounds; they would only have
stood for things; so that if he would express in writing
the idea he has when he sounds the word <i>Vescovo</i>,
he must use the letters <i>Episcopus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>In short, whatever the difficulties and inconveniences
now are, they will be more easily surmounted now,
than hereafter; and some time or other it must be done,
or our writing will become the same with the Chinese,
as to the difficulty of learning and using it. And it
would already have been such, if we had continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
the Saxon spelling and writing used by our forefathers.</p>

rather why is the spelling of <i>lustre</i>, <i>metre</i>, <i>theatre</i>, <i>not</i> changed? The
cases are precisely similar. The Englishman who first wrote <i>number</i> for
<i>nombre</i>, had no greater authority to make the change, than any modern
writer has to spell <i>lustre</i>, <i>metre</i> in a similar manner, <i>luster</i>, <i>meter</i>. The
change in the first instance was a valuable one; it conformed the spelling
to the pronunciation, and I have taken the liberty, in all my writings, to
pursue the principle in <i>luster</i>, <i>meter</i>, <i>miser</i>, <i>theater</i>, <i>sepulcher</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

one year, as he can now in four. This is not a supposition&mdash;it is an assertion
capable of proof; and yet people, never knowing, or having forgot
the labor of learning, suppose the present mode to be the easiest.
No person, but one who has taught children, has any idea of the difficulty
of learning to spell and pronounce our language in its present form.</p></div>
